Plus I genuinely believe if you are decent enough you probably don't need a bootcamp to land you a job."
108zqmx,j3vmcut,yellowmamba_97,2023-01-11 11:03:43,9,"Damn, these tuition fees are almost equivalent to the MSc computer science degrees of UT Austin and Georgia Tech. Bootcamps are in my opinion not worth it if you pay such a heavy amount. You could basically replicate their curriculum with free or courses with a lower fee of the applicable vendors, such as Google or Amazon."
108zqmx,j3w0frz,j__neo,2023-01-11 13:28:18,6,"Hello there, I'd suggest checking out [Data Engineer Camp](https://dataengineercamp.com/) if you haven't already. Our next cohort is kicking off July/August 2023. Student testimonial [here](https://app.vouchfor.com/116QBDHIvO)."
108zqmx,j3xxnwy,chrisgarzon19,2023-01-11 20:49:59,2,"My problem with bootcamps is that’s not actually focused on getting you a job. I mean, 800 hours in 20 weeks?

You have 40 hours a week available?

That’s the difference between bootcamps and mentors btw 

A bootcamp focuses on teaching every nuance possible that you may never use again (like school)

Vs. a mentor who’s job is to accelerate your path


P.S I’m a proponent for free over bootcamps like these that are TOO structured"
108zqmx,j3x1h9b,tentative_guy22,2023-01-11 17:33:55,2,OP i hope you don’t feel discouraged by the feedback. They mean well. Thanks for sharing your effort.
108zqmx,j3ygpcg,None,2023-01-11 22:47:51,1,"if a bootcamp isnt free, its a scam. tech is unbelievably toxic with this crap."
108zqmx,j3z5ss5,Altruistic-Choice-37,2023-01-12 01:38:06,1,it's overpriced
108zqmx,j3vx7o4,jppbkm,2023-01-11 13:00:21,0,These both look like much worse content (and value) than what's available for free or cheap online.
108zqmx,j3vcgsm,_whitezetsu,2023-01-11 08:45:24,16,Apologies if this sounds rude but this is a ridiculous amount to pay for something you can learn for absolutely free.
108zqmx,j3vshvp,ThisMud5529,2023-01-11 12:15:04,4,"Yeah I totally agree. There loads of free materials and resources online. You might only need to spend some on cloud deployments if you've never used their free trials. 

I know some people prefer to go to these kind of bootcamps to have a structured and curated learning experience. Personally, for that price why not wait a month and try out courses on other platforms (ie. udemy/codecademy/coursera etc) Some even offer 30-day money back guarantee. And surely give DataTalks a try. It's free and starting on Jan 16 I think."
108zqmx,j3wcdqv,Proof_Elk_2281,2023-01-11 14:56:44,4,"I will second this and say you should do the DE zoomcamp. I did it with just basic coding experience (mostly R for some stats related to grad research) and had lots of interest in my resume when I was a fresh grad.

The best part is that you can focus on the parts that interest you the most. If you're really interested in analytics engineering you can go deep into a project with an ELT stack, if you want to focus on big data ETL you can do something with Spark, etc.. I did dbt and Airflow because I just picked something I time for while also finishing my degree. This time around I'm following along again and am going to do something with Kafka, just to learn the tech because I think it's interesting.

The only thing Alexey doesn't really cover that I think a paid bootcamp would is interview prep including DSA. But resources like neetcode have made things like DSA a lot more accessible to learn for free imo."
108zqmx,j3wbc8j,raz_the_kid0901,2023-01-11 14:49:42,1,I am going to give that datatalks a try. I need structure in my life.
108zqmx,j3yyc56,jun_dagster,2023-01-12 00:45:59,1,Appreciate letting me know about the Zoom camp!
108zqmx,j3wwdgw,mrchowmein,2023-01-11 17:03:27,2,"Yep, if one wants to pay university rates, might as well get that cs degree as that will go further than any BootCamp."
108zqmx,j6hc7e2,BrackishClarity,2023-01-30 09:20:57,2,Are there any mentorship type programs out there?
108zqmx,j3whkao,tigerkingsam,2023-01-11 15:30:58,6,What you’re saying is true but some people can’t self study and need some structure in place for them to focus like college. But yeah Datatalks club makes a lot of sense
108zqmx,j497pfp,None,2023-01-14 01:10:16,1,I actually want to eventually go for masters. But I need my professional to be strong enough to be able to get into a decent programme. The UT Austin programme looks to be decent and it's affordable. I just need to strengthen my profile
108zqmx,j6hmrcd,chrisgarzon19,2023-01-30 11:46:17,1,"[I have my own, so I’m biased!](https://dataengineerinterview.com/products/)"
108zqmx,j4978ly,None,2023-01-14 01:06:42,1,"Yeah that's where I am as well. Additionally, the camp I'm looking at will help give me a solid python base which I think I lack. After I'm done I'm going to go through the DTC stuff. DE, MLE, and MLOps. The way it was set up looks good. I just don't think I have the base to get what I need from it. It's a much more difficult ramp up without the background and one can get lost. The structure helps one realise it's just part of the journey"

10v7ult,j7fzfl4,St_Melangell,2023-02-06 15:04:41,2,"It has its good points but in my opinion, it’s far too wordy. Distil each job down to 4-5 of your top achievements, backing them up with numbers & data if applicable (such as simplifying a process, saving 80% of admin time). Also for the two studentships, I’d put them in a separate section, maybe Internships or similar."
10v7ult,j7g5gpp,gthirteen_13,2023-02-06 15:46:52,2,"First of all 2 pages? No way sir.

Why the graphic? Why isn't your name centered?  Why are the headers centered?  Why are there colors?  Shadows over the headers? you might think this looks fancy but it really just looks like it's formatted incorrectly.

get rid of ""data engineer"", the objective statement, and signature competencies.  Then take your education & affiliations/technical proficiencies combine them and call it skills and put that first thing after your name/info/etc...

Then you need to concentrate on shortening all the work experience down to the most important things, and be precise and use data.  Possibly changing the format to summarizing the exp (instead of bullets) and then bullet listing 3 accomplishments per job would be the way.  You might also think to omit the aws cloud admin, and ""student"" exp, and add an education section.

You have a lot of work to do before this is presentable to anyone that reads resumes.  I tossed it right away because it overwhelmed me with length PLUS it had an objective summary.  

You have a lot of great things but we don't need to know every single task you did, summarize.

Any tips on how I can ""datafy"" my accomplishments? i.e., ""My automation of widget production saved 98% of operational budget etc etc"".

""Addressed the lack of automation in data vetting process by creating python scripts that check the data and create reports based on existing criteria"", something like that."

That being said, the way to get better at ANYTHING related to coding is by practicing.  Pick a project that you care about, or start doing the data pipelines yourself at your job instead of handing them to DE’s. And that’s how you will get better at Data Engineering.

I attended one of these bootcamp and can provide you more info if you DM me.

Long story short, it is not necessary if you have the drive and a clear goal. I truly believe you can learn everything online if you want.

However if you are like me and needs that extra push and more hand holding, bootcamp can help to some degree. In the end it is up to you to make it in this field. Don't expect to come out with a job if you are not putting in the work.

In my case, it was not a bad idea, I have some SQL and ETL experience before and want to make it to the next level. Also money was not that much of an issue to me since I also did some time in the OG sector.

I just needed the structured and guided learning towards DE."

You want hands on experience.  Instead of $5-15K, spend $1000 on testing out the cloud for yourself.  

I was looking at a $4K Microsoft BI program a few years back.  It was going to take 9 months to complete.  Made a deal with myself that I could complete Microsoft Certs on my own, for less, in a shorter amount of time.  Posted those on LinkedIn and the recruiters found me.  Did the same with Azure and AWS.  

These certs usually cost $100, exam prep is about $150, plus a bunch of youtube and Udemy (about $15/course)."

I'm glad you took a different route while committing time to self development which led to you being noticed by the recruiters.

u76io5,i5cmu69,vasaforever,2022-04-19 15:01:40,2,"Some bootcamps can vary in quality so dig into their posted results and try to talk to other grads. If you can find a bootcamp from a public university like University of Michigan, MIT, Ohio State, that's a little better as you're getting the university's name and brand weight behind it, along with some access to teachers/teaching assistants that teach undergrad courses. 
You can also look at online industry job programs like Udacity, who have a pretty good Data program which also includes LinkedIn development, resume review, and job socials with top employers in your area or online depending on how the program is done.

Alex explains the path relatively well and also mentions the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera: https://youtu.be/yDG5KiiOZcQ

Luke goes into the technical and programming approach to how to learn Data in 2022 which I think is very well organized. https://youtu.be/CC66RXeTn_4

Tina also has a great discussion on how to maximize your learning in this space: https://youtu.be/Axu4tJl8gbM

In general, the job postings you see call for SQL, Python/R, some sort of BI tool so PowerBI or Tableau, and you're seeing cloud more."
u76io5,i5cj58k,None,2022-04-19 14:37:34,1,I'd start by asking your employer if there are any help desk positions available within the company in your area. See if they will pay for industry standard certifications even if there aren't any entry level tech positions. The most common cert is A+ the rest are much more specialized.
u76io5,i5cpya4,zubzup,2022-04-19 15:21:50,1,"Thank you. Am I able to skip data analytics and dive straigjr into Data Engineering, DEVops or data science. Reason is data analytics is entry level and less paid."
u76io5,i5cpmrv,zubzup,2022-04-19 15:19:50,2,Thing is I am already at a pay level and have financial obligations. I am also 31. Cannot go to a help desk job at this point in life..
u76io5,i5cr31t,vasaforever,2022-04-19 15:28:50,2,"DevOps is a completely different skill set than Data Engineering and using a different skill set and knowledge base.

Yes you can start learning Data Engineering now as it'll cover most of the same stuff you'd learn as an analyst except the BI tools. You'll need to have a good understanding of data storage, databases, APIs etc, cloud, etc. It's a lot more involved due to the number of tools and language.

It's more of a question of if you're able to get a Data Engineering role off the street without previous tech experience. If you have a finance or math degree, or requisite certifications and solid portfolio it's possible. It may be worth looking in your company to see if there are internal roles to increase your chances as well."
u76io5,i5cqnve,CWykes,2022-04-19 15:26:06,3,"Even if you have certifications and boot camps completed I’m pretty sure you’ll need to start in a support role like help desk anyways. The only thing that would allow you to start above support, besides connections or luck, is related experience. It’s an unfortunate pay cut many people have to take to start a career in this field, but if you like IT then it’s worth it"

&#x200B;

To give other advice,   Python is a decent starting point and diving into data reporting platforms like PowerBI, tableau or crystal reports is a good way to get a foot in the door"
u76io5,i5cqk9t,None,2022-04-19 15:25:30,1,Maybe stay at your job and even try going back to school. To safely make a lateral move across two different careers with no experience or technical training will be challenging but not impossible.

Your question borders on being binary and can't be answered by anyone but you. It's about you, your current education, goals, timeline, and what aspects of IT or CS that you enjoy. Since you're switching careers there is a different decision tree and requirements that can influence your decision.

u76hcp,i5dxwsc,zubzup,2022-04-19 19:56:19,1,"I agree.  


I am considering weclouddata and light house labs. Both are bassed in Toronto but are pricey ($10k)  


I could also go for MIT Data science course which is cheaper but I feel it will be more corporate."
u76hcp,i5erknk,Deep-Temperature,2022-04-19 23:11:38,1,"Before going for pricey bootcamps, consider going for free online material. Data science sounds nice but in reality the work you will get at entry level will be an analyst and if you are lucky some data science. Please tread with caution. There are other technologies/ skillsets that are easier to get into and pay will be good. It's better to go for full stack developement, DevOps, RPA,AWS etc."

rm8uos,hpkw766,BoneThrone92,2021-12-22 17:38:33,15,I would heavily recommend against this. The best way to pivot to data engineering is to start hopping to more technical roles. Trying getting a job as a data analyst and start using python. After a few years you'll be ready to make the jump. Hiring managers will prefer a BI dev or data analyst with work experience over a bootcamp.
rm8uos,hplksq4,mrchowmein,2021-12-22 20:24:08,6,"If you're an analyst already, try to find a position such as data analyst that works closely with DE/DS teams so you can learn the technical side. The bootcamps are not that useful beyond just giving you some background info about DE. It's a good way to polish your skillset, but that's about it in my opinion. People here ask about bootcamps every once in awhile. Between my friends and I who are also DEs at multiple companies, no one is getting hired based on DE bootcamps.  You kinda need to fall under 3 categories: an advanced degree that is CS or data related (such as chemistry where you have to write programs to perform analysis on a cluster), seasoned software engineer, or a data analyst. There are not many jr positions available in general as the upskilling required is relatively high compared to other types of software engineering roles. So the route for the non-engineer who doesnt want to go back to school is usually the data analyst route."
rm8uos,hplgld2,nudgekennels,2021-12-22 19:55:40,2,"Thanks, that makes sense. A follow up question — so WeCloudData offers the students an opportunity to work on “real client project” that they take on from various companies. I think that if I tried to get a job, I would be working, as you said, as an analyst. A part of me thinks that it would be better to be able to put a line on my resume that’s actually data engineering work, even if it’s pro bono through a bootcamp. What do you think?"
rm8uos,hplmlaz,nudgekennels,2021-12-22 20:36:13,1,"Thanks, that makes sense.

Or do you think that being an analyst and working closely with DE/DS team is better?"
rm8uos,hpmekfg,pacific_plywood,2021-12-22 23:55:40,1,"If you are already doing programmatic work, then - given some self-studying on the side - you could just get these roles without paying for a bootcamp"
rm8uos,hpm20c1,mrchowmein,2021-12-22 22:22:06,2,"I dunno what real client project means. How long is the bootcamp. If you can see a sample client project and is complex enough maybe it’s worth it.

rm8uos,hpm3m0o,nudgekennels,2021-12-22 22:33:39,1,"It’s fairly long. 25 weeks. Lectures Wednesday nights and Saturday all day. We’re supposed to work on the client projects during the week starting about 4-7 weeks in. I’m not currently working as an analyst, I just have about 5 years experience from a while ago. So I could either be applying for analyst jobs and doing the bootcamp part-time (which doesn’t come with the client project), or I could just do the bootcamp fulltime (which comes with the client project). I’ve asked about sample client project, but they said that because it’s for an actual client they can’t share it with me. It’s done with the guidance of one of the instructors. I feel like I might as well do the full-time, since it might take a bit of time to find an analyst job anyway? I’m not sure. Really appreciate the input by the way."

There are many introductory courses available for free on youtube if you wanna get a good introduction into the field of data engineering. But an instructor guided course is always better.

qaw2to,hh5s1jk,larry_is_not_my_name,2021-10-18 21:55:00,1,"Try to find the most reputable bootcamp or course you can that's as close to what you're looking for as possible.  A lot of your learning will come post bootcamp, either through your own initiative or on the job.

A bootcamp grad myself from a few years back, mostly it was a great way to get introduced to others in code and build a network while learning a few things.  That is, while a lot of the learning was ok (some of it was good and some of it was not), the real benefit was being in that space mentally and meeting others who want to do the same thing.

Since graduating and through work, I've built a lot of other projects using different tech stacks.  This is where most of my actual learning has taken place.

TL;DR Think of a bootcamp as a great place to start your learning rather than as a place to master anything.  More importantly, most people find that the network they make at a bootcamp to be more valuable than the learning, so do what you can to make solid connections."

Data Warehouse, Data Lake, Spark, Airflow. I took this DEND with colleagues at work, and it felt like we can talk data engineering with a common set of knowledge. The DEND wasn't about the tools though: them covering OLTP vs OLAP, star schema, etc was great - as many DEs that I came across so far didn't seem to know about them and I found it frustrating.

I should mention, DataCamp also has a Data Engineer track that is much cheaper and covers similar content, but does lack in ""project"" experience. Recommend this one too.

10nx6e8,j6kky0y,epicpython,2023-01-30 23:58:47,2,"Hey, so I completed the SWE bootcamp from Practicum. (almost...I'm on Sprint 15, but I got a job, and that's the bit that matters, right?)

My background- I came in already knowing C#, Java, and Python, had played around and made some projects (mostly games) already- and I wanted to get more experience in web development.

I would say it's decent if you already have some programming experience and want to learn frontend (Javascript, HTML, CSS).You learn the basics of backend too- as someone else said, they don't focus on it too much.If you don't already know how to program, it might be a bit rough- they teach you basic programming concepts (if statements, variables etc) using Javascript. I don't think Javascript is a very beginner friendly language.

You can take it at your own pace, which is great, and there are office hours (zoom meetings) with tutors at various times- I think there's at least 1 office hour every day of the week.

I will say that when I started, the program costs $4000 (that's what I paid) and now it's $8900. So, considering the price, it's quite possible that there's a better bootcamp that covers the same material. For $4000 though I thought it was a really good deal.

Another thing to consider is that it says ""10 months""...well.. it's probably going to take me about a year to finish. Admittedly I did slow myself down by job searching before I finished. But I would be prepared to take a year to compete it."
10nx6e8,j6xw1s4,Successful-Win-5876,2023-02-02 17:48:41,2,"The SWE program is 10 months long and I think definitely more intense than some of the others. I'm not sure how much material other bootcamps can cover in 3-6 months.

Let's be real: even after 10 months, you're not going to be an expert at anything. Learning to code is hard, but like with anything else, you get better with deliberate and intentional practice. Practicum gives you a solid starting point in JavaScript, React and Node. How much better you get at these technologies is up to you: by building more projects and engaging in more self directed learning.

Career guidance is decent. Only US based students are eligible for the career acceleration program so bear that in mind. You'll still have access to a career advisor.

I think the true strength of this program is in the support of the community: tutors regularly hold office hours, senior students are around to guide and mentor. Help is often just a Slack message away.

The Apiary externship program gives you the opportunity to work on real world projects in a team environment. These are always led by experienced senior engineers, so the workflows are pretty much the same as with a real world company."

I have been learning Web development by myself but this bootcamp gave me a proper structure and time-line to my journey. The learning platform does a great job in laying out the theory and hands on. The bootcamp not only trains you on technical stuffs but also supports you with mentors who are professional Web developers themselves and always ready to help you out in projects and even side projects. The bootcamp also have community managers who are like our shock absorbers and a great emotional help. Apart from everything else, I like that the bootcamp promotes healthy learning environment and gives us many opportunities to work in real-world like scenarios through its various initiatives.

 1. Very supportive community of students, mentors and community managers.

3rd red flag. They offer multiple bootcamps. Bootcamps are money grabs, when a single bootcamp offers 2+ different programs, they probably aren’t as good as a program that specializes in 1 program they run 

4th red flag. They teach 1 module on backend. I’m sorry backend should be atleast 50% of the curriculum. Seems like they expect you to learn MVC architecture, node.js, mongodb in under 2 weeks.

For more info on red flag. There are “15 sprints”. 1 covers express and node. 2nd covers user auth. 3rd covers requests to the api you just learned how to make.

Hope this helps cheers"

There is actually a major project, though it might be hard to tell- Sprints 4-15 have you working on the same project! You code the frontend, connect it to their api, then code your own api/backend.   


Trying to figure out how they came up with 6 projects...at least for me personally, here's what I made:  
\- Basic ""About me"" website to learn simple HTML/CSS  
\- Bigger webpage with multiple sections  
\-Another webpage with multiple sections, had some CSS animations and a HTML form (no backend for it though- you can't actually submit data to a server)  
\-Webpage that works on mobile, and 2 different desktop resolutions- teaches you about media queries.   
\-Group project ""externship""-basically an unpaid internship where you make a website for an actual company. I helped make this site: [https://product.arqlite.com/](https://product.arqlite.com/) I mostly learned how to use Git/GitHub in a team from this one. We also did a bit of React. Stuff you learn would depend on the project. 

\-Big final project, which is like sprints 4-15 and I still have to finish...You make the frontend using React, and the backend using Node.js + Mongo DB. I still need to do the last step, which is to deploy it on Google Cloud.

That's only 5 projects- I think they added a new project called ""What To Wear"" which has you access an API to get weather info and display pictures of different clothing. But I didn't do that project- they added it to an earlier sprint right after I finished it I think.  


>4th red flag. They teach 1 module on backend. I’m sorry backend should be atleast 50% of the curriculum. Seems like they expect you to learn MVC architecture, node.js, mongodb in under 2 weeks.

That's a fair point. They rebranded it from ""Web Developer"" to ""Software Engineer"" without really changing the curriculum. So that's my guess as to why the backend bit is so short.  
For me personally, the backend bit being short was OK- I started job searching around sprint 11 or so, before I learned all the backend stuff. I ended up getting a job where I code in C#- so although I don't use the specific technologies I learned from the bootcamp (MongoDB, Node.js), the general concepts are very helpful to know. (api calls, POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, HTML error codes, database CRUD).  
I didn't learn MVC architecture at all, do they say they cover it?  
But yeah if your dream is to be a backend Node.js + MongoDB dev specifically...I mean they cover the basics, but I bet there's another bootcamp that does it in more depth."
10nx6e8,j6h30mh,michaelnovati,2023-01-30 07:14:34,1,"I wouldn't say red flag, but they are owned by Yandex, which is a multinational giant tech company, originally the ""Russian Google"", so there are pros and cons to being owned by a giant company but it's something to think about and not at all obvious from their website."
10nx6e8,j6lel45,epicpython,2023-01-31 03:39:41,4,"Sure! I started searching for a job about 8 months into the bootcamp, around sprint 11. Practicum has a pretty good career prep course they have you go through-teaches you about how to make a good LinkedIn profile/resume/GitHub portfolio. Also has some tips on interviews- both general interviews, where they are trying to see if your personality is a good fit + technical interviews where you have to do coding tasks. They also recommend some sites where you can apply to jobs- LinkedIn, Indeed, and Angellist were the 3 I mainly used.

I did things I bit out of order because I started applying to jobs before I even finished the formal ""interview prep"" course. So I got help on my resume+ some practice interviews early. But normally, you would finish the interview prep course, then submit your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub portfolio. You get feedback on those, and then you have a practice ""HR interview"" (meant to mimic the initial interview, often with a HR rep, where you won't get technical coding questions, just asked more general interview questions). You also have a practice ""technical interview"" where you do some practice JavaScript questions, meant to mimic a technical interview. ( I did my practice technical interview early/ before I finished the career prep stuff- I had an actual interview coming up, so I quickly scheduled a practice one).

I definitely had a bit of an advantage because I had coding skills prior to the bootcamp. I know that my resume was stronger than someone who had only done the bootcamp projects- I had some previous projects  in C#/Unity and Python, plus I'd tutored a kid in Python. I also think I had an advantage in technical interviews- just because I had some of the basic logic/thinking skills from already knowing how to program. I was also able to apply to more jobs because I knew more programming languages. I applied to jobs for Python, C#, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript. Anything that mentioned one of those languages and asked for 3 years of experience or less. (Note: when looking at job postings, they will list a ton of stuff. They don't expect you to know all of it. The job I got mentioned C#, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, which I know, but also unit testing and .NET which I didn't know when I applied. Do NOT be afraid to apply to a job just because you don't know every technology they list.)

One of the things they mentioned in the career prep course was to try to get interviews in 2 ways- networking and applying to a TON of jobs. I did LinkedIn easy apply to anything I was remotely qualified for. Applied to like 100 jobs ish in total.

I got really close to getting a job from Cerner- did well in the interview+ technical interview. But then they had layoffs, and a couple weeks later I got a generic email saying I didn't get the job. That was actually really frustrating cause I'd been so sure I was getting the job- they literally said they wanted to hire me and just needed to finalize the paperwork. 

Also got really close with a game development company, but they said I didn't do quite well enough on the technical interview/ they didn't want to hire someone quite as junior as me. 

I had interviews with 3 companies around the same time. 1 of them gave me a job offer, but it was in person, and I really wanted remote. Basically it was my third favorite out of the 3. This is where Practicum helped out- once you finish the ""career prep"" course you get assigned a career coach who you meet with once a week, and can message anytime for advice. She was able to help me draft some killer emails to follow through with the other 2 companies. Basically saying, ""hey I got a job offer, but I'd rather work for you, any chance you can give me an offer by next week?"" One of them responded, had me do a quick final interview, and gave me an offer! (Career coach also helped me with some emails to negotiate benefits/salary).

I like my new job a lot. It's remote, and my coworkers are super nice. I'm learning a lot, which is a bit overwhelming. But my boss knows that I have a ton to learn, so I'm not overloaded with too many tasks at once. I'm also pretty decent at googling and asking questions.

Hope this helps!"

In person job was going to pay 55k/year, I negotiated up to 60k/year. Game design company said 70k was ""too high"" when I talked salary with them, so I would guess they'd pay 60k if I got the job. The job offer I got pays 60k/year. I live in a pretty cheap area so that's a good salary for me. For reference, I made 50k/ year at my previous non-tech job. So I got a 10k/year ""raise""- not bad. I also expect I can get raises at my current company as I gain more experience."

The pay was terrible, but the job was enjoyable and better than most jobs I had worked up until that point. After about a year of doing manual QA I pivoted to another company and now I lead our team's automated testing efforts. If you can get a foot in the door at any level of QA, you can easily identify what skills you need to focus on to move to a better paying position.

I have not done a bootcamp like this, but I very strongly advise you to reconsider. Once you give them your money there is a good chance you're going to find out that you paid thousands of dollars for somebody to poorly explain guru99 articles for you. I know it seems like maybe this will be that little step to get you over the finish line, but more than likely it's not. 

I don't know your circumstances, background, or anything else about you, and honestly it doesn't really matter. You don't need a certification, you don't need that degree, you don't need this bootcamp. Seriously, you don't need it. Apply for QA jobs that you don't meet the qualifications for. Interview for jobs you know you aren't going to get. See what questions they are asking and focus your learning on those areas.

What does your resume look like? Even if you have enough to make it two or three pages long, don't do it! I always try to avoid anything too flashy or overly colorful. Definitely don't include any ""skill bars"" if you have them, that seems to be a trend but it doesn't really make any sense if you think about it.

Finally, how are you trying to present yourself in interviews? It can be tempting to try to paint yourself as an expert in all things, but that can very easily backfire. The most important thing to a potential employer is whether or not you'll work well with others. If you come across as completely deadpan or overly confident, it can raise red flags for managers. If they think you won't ""jive"" with their team, then even if you're exceptional they'll choose somebody else. 

All of that being said, a lot of it is just luck, so please try not to be too hard on yourself. It's RNG like anything else. Even if something has a relatively high chance of success, like 20%, there is still a chance, albeit low, it could still take you 500 tries. Persistence in the face of this kind of adversity is utterly brutal and taxing, but it is critical to getting where you want to be."

1128yp6,j8z5he3,Frogchairy,2023-02-18 00:12:33,2,"**NOTE:** I am reading this chart using the Whole Signs House System (despite the supplied chart being drawn in placidus). Given the placement of the AC in a late degree of Leo, this actually shifts the chart a lot! 

**Personality:** The chart ruler is the 2H Sun. The native would define their sense of self through their material pleasures, possessions, and income. They were likely determined to pursue the acquisition of goods and resources to support themself. Periods of scarcity would result in feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem. The domicile lord of the Sun is Mercury which is in retrograde motion and placed in the 3H. The Sun and Mercury are in aversion. The rx and aversion likely contribute to the native feeling misunderstood. They may have had some strong ideas, but they struggled to have their ideas truly seen and understood.

Additionally, the native likely enjoyed being alone. The moon is in the 12H and is her own domicile ruler. The native probably found their sense of security and peace while in isolation. Jupiter exalted in the 12H would also indicate an abundance of enjoyable and productive alone time for the native. Probably very invested in mediation and reflection and spiritual growth? Given the presence of Pluto and Mars, the native could have struggled with significant (and potentially violent) mental health challenges. Luckily they are also with the domicile sect light, so perhaps some of those aspects were mitigated.

The 12H looks like the most prominent part of the chart. Interested to see who the native is and how that played out!

**Career:** With Chiron close to the MC in the 10H, I would suspect that the native could have been a healer of some sort. Perhaps their own traumas were very public and important in their work. With the MC in Taurus I’m tempted to lean into the healer potential and suggest a massage therapist or even a reiki energy worker… (this probably isn’t correct though given that they are famous ahaha). If not a healer, then perhaps an artist of some kind. Their art would have reflected their personal trauma and centered on vulnerable topics. The ruler of the MC is in the 4H, so perhaps their work was more private… placed in Scorpio, perhaps this work was sexual in some manner…..? Lilith is also on the descendent in the 7H. So maybe thats not so far off. Sex worker?

**Controversy:** I’m looking at their rx Mercury mentioned previously… In the 3H this placement would have had regular attention. Perhaps they had some kind of consistent platform and following to share their ideas through. They might have even had a large impact of their local community. Given their potentially promiscuous work (?), perhaps they were seen as controversial for what they were trying to accomplish. With their Lilith conjunct DC in Aquarius, perhaps they were a sort of rebellious and radical person (or at least they were seen as such by the dominant culture). And with Uranus under Aries in the 9H, the native tried to share and educate on new and radical ideas. Given the 2H Neptune, maybe some of their ideas were not well supported by evidence, circumstance, practicality. Idk….

Regardless of the specifics, this person was certainly involved in some kind of taboo topics that the dominant culture wasn't buying despite their preaching!

**Relationships:** For children, the 5H is empty, but ruled by Jupiter. Jupiter is exalted in Cancer. These would be strong indicators for high fertility and many children. Though not positive if they had kids of not. For romance, venus in the 4H is a very nostalgic placement. Perhaps they entered a relationship with someone from their childhood. If not, they could have met someone through their family or close to their home. The ruler of Scorpio Venus is Mars in the 12H. Perhaps these topics were connected somehow. Additionally, the 7H is ruled by Saturn in the 6H. There would be some clear strains in relationships due to health issues. Speaking of health, they might have struggled with chronic pain or lack of proper diagnosis / medical attention. For friends, it looks like they had a pretty average experience. Probably a chatterbox.. not a lot of significant placements here.

**Death:** The ruler of the 8H is Jupiter. This planet is placed in the 12H. To me, this could be a significant indicator of death via overdose. Perhaps the native, in their mental health struggles, abused drugs and alcohol as coping mechanisms. Overindulgence in such substances would have led to addiction and other complications that may be related to their death."

I’ll have to get back to you in the morning to confirm those other details, I’m tied up for the evening. Very impressive though!!"

You asked about potential scandals in marriage, sex and perhaps a secret child.  This person was married three times. The 2nd marriage ended after our native had a high profile affair with a playboy bunny who he later married (our mystery person is male). He has three kids with his first wife, he adopted the children of his 2nd wife as his own, and he fathered another child with his third wife. Busy dude!"

1. Career- this person is known for one major accomplishment. It is associated with the cancer stellium.  Insofar as cancer is the 12th, think about it as really far away from home. Insofar as cancer is the 11th, think of organizations that this person might have been involved with. 

2. Yes there is a spiritual / psychological / unusual side of this person that does lead to an entire story arc in their life. But it comes after their first accomplishment, and as a direct result of their first accomplishment. 

3. This persons family life is not what they are known for but there are some interesting details here nonetheless.  Three marriages, one ending because of an affair. Multiple children (from each marriage) so yes a lot of kids. 


This is not meant to be a hard chart, don’t over think it! I can tell you’re circling around from up high. Let go of family and personal stuff for the moment, focus on one major accomplishment."

1128yp6,j94r8zf,Frogchairy,2023-02-19 05:52:35,2,"Hmmmm okokok. I had to really think, but this is my running theme that keeps popping up: 

The entire 12H stell is squared by the rx Uranus. 

9H rx Uranus in Aries has to be some pretty significant new and weird ideas/beliefs.

Hmmmmm. I’ve often heard of Aqua/Uranus heavy people being described as alien… and Aries is the sign of spring and new life, so perhaps that could be an indicator of NEW life (extraterrestrials) 

So maybe the native believed in aliens. And that clearly impacted them very personally.

Maybe as a result of proclaiming such beliefs (that aliens exist) they were isolated / ostracized. 

Who the native is? I have no idea. I’m personally not all that interested in the whole genre of conspiracy theorists, so I wouldn’t be surprised if I’ve never heard of them. 

Maybe someone related to scientology? Only person I can name would be Tom Cruise lol idk"
1128yp6,j8l75ze,ilovelamp011001,2023-02-15 02:54:45,2,"Wonderful!  I’m glad I asked you too because you brought in some things I didn’t see at first. Let’s break out some threads:

1. Wealth / money. This person’s personal wealth is not a very significant feature of their biography. They made more than enough for themselves but it’s really not what’s interesting about the story. Now that said, this person’s story wouldn’t be possible without access to a lot of money.  Viewing the matter through a different lens might be more productive in this case. Are there some other ways you can reconcile money in the chart?

2.  The individual was not necessarily known to be charismatic (I googled ‘was this person charismatic’ and got nothing helpful). But that probably depends who you would ask.  I might suggest focusing some attention on the Sun’s relationship to the midheaven, as well as sect considerations, to get more productivity out of the sun symbolism. 

3.  Matters concerning spirituality, as well as sudden epiphanies, are a prominent feature of this person’s biography. It would be worth diving into these topics in more detail.  This is not the first thing that would stand out in this person’s Wikipedia bio, but is important. 

4. Mental health: this person is known to be very lucid, sharp, and credible.  

Nice work so far! Keep going!"
1128yp6,j8ldhxq,ilovelamp011001,2023-02-15 03:47:04,2,"You’re doing great! 

1. Family / generational wealth: I heard you wrestle with this saying potential coming from money (sun in 2nd) or perhaps the opposite that there was a childhood issue surrounding family wealth that was a motivator (visa vi your assessment of Venus, fortune, midheaven, etc).  The latter is more true.  The family comes from a place of lack, and the symbolism of Taurus is very apparent when examining this person’s family history. The degree to which the family history was a motivating influence is not something that’s clear to me. 

2. Success in public eye- true.  Can you zero in on this?  What are they known for? 

3.  Intelligence- yes as you indicated by sun in Virgo this person is very analytical, detail oriented, process oriented, focused, etc.  This is a noteworthy and important element to who this person is. 

4. Keep exploring cancer….

Nice job!"

I've been thinking this over all day lol, I truly don't have a clue.

If I try and think about a ""Cancerian or Moon style accomplishment"" there's just so many possibilities, but... uh... maybe three broad areas stand out??:

Popularising or bringing something to the masses or to common every day life so that it's more known about, available and/or relevant to all; possibly being recognisable to many, having some kind of impact on many, stirring interest and attention, potentially directing trends

Studying and discovering something of benefit to humanity, to life on earth or to a specific group 

Some kind of accomplishment related to public life and freedoms of citizenry, involvement in public freedoms of movement, expression, cultural or religious practices, information dispersal etc; or perhaps in the sense of accomplishments related to travel, movement as freedoms of the people to wander or mingle

I tried to pick broad stuff that could apply in many areas but they are based on specific associations (Moon - masses, commonality, popularity, daily life, public interest and attention; study, study of history, study of medicine, bodies, observation, cycles, the physical and real, growth and corruption, Moon as planet with most relevance to Earth; travel, movement, wandering, the city, the people, the public, people power, gatherings).

Since he married a playboy bunny... I mean, the Moon represents mirrors, which are used in the lenses for cameras, was his accomplishment Lunar in the sense of transmitting light (awareness, information)...?

Moon also can be a bringer of resources, food, drink, etc, taking care of needs.

But these aren't accomplishments... I don't know.

I'm probably massively over-thinking this one. 🤔"

They’re a Scorpio rising with the ruler of their ascendant tightly conjunct Saturn in the 8th house. I would consider this person to be “dark” but strongly intuitive and empathetic. Wise beyond their years. May have had to grow up fast but generally, this person is probably well liked with Venus conjunct the sun and squaring Jupiter. Might be overly indulgent. 
2. I’m compelled to believe that this person is a singer/songwriter. Ruler of the 10th in the 2nd. Moon on the MC. Ruler of the 11th in the 3rd. I get songwriter from Virgo on the MC. This person is known for their vulnerability. I’m also wanting to say this person might be a sex icon, or at the very least, highly attractive. Scorpio rising with BML right on the ascendant. 
3. I want to say that this person didn’t marry. They have Uranus in the 7th and the ruler of the 7th is in a Saturn-ruled sign and combust. As for kids, probably not either. Ruler of the 5th in its fall conjunct Saturn."

The moon is the sect light. We see the moon translating these scary / uncomfortable things into the career space, especially with moon on the midheaven making a big reputation of it. 

Moon on midheaven might indicate a relationship to the silver screen or television. In Virgo we see something that may fit the idea of writing or publishing, maybe a book author. Mercury ruler of moon is seen as a morning star in Capricorn alongside Venus and the sun which could suggest empire-building or world-building being an important center around these stories which the moon is bringing out in the 10th. The influence of Pluto up there in Leo is certainly contributing to this person’s established reputation as being deep, dark, mysterious and perhaps a little uncomfortable to sit with for too long at times. 

How we doing?"
10usyl2,j7rn7cd,AndromedanHomesick,2023-02-08 22:36:20,2,"1. This person is potentially secretive about themselves. But we see them as having an intense personality and possibly constantly changing their appearance. They probably change their ethics, morals, belief system when challenged emotionally which has affects on their daily routine and health. Possibly having health issues surrounding  They probably have had difficulties to lift their own boundaries or restrictions upon themself to change their ethics, morals, belief system. This type of energy potentially brings alot of stress and anxiety which can trigger abrunt outbursts of anger or irritability. This can cause alot of accidents, cerebrovascular diseases, headaches, migranes, insomnia, mental illnesses, neurological disorders and vision problems. These natives are a powerhouse but often go long periods ignoring symptoms of health issues. Native is possibly involved in some form of communications that is emotionally attached to their friends, groups, humanitarianism efforts, hopes and dreams. They are loyal and powerful leaders or voices in their work that has ties to extended family, neighbors, community or education. They are very positive and optmistic about their values. What they value must be in balance and harmony with their own spirituality beliefs. Their communications can be slow but methodical as things must align with their own mindset and values. Their home is unique and different. They find pleasure in harmony and peace. Their relationships are strong and practical with their siblings, extended family, neighbors, community.  The native possibly is able to inspire in a unique way in communications in/of fear, power and control, transformation, psychological issues, death. 
2. They potentially work(ed) in healthcare, social technology, religious industry, prison/legal system, music industry, astrology or magic industry. It potentially was either the career the mother was in or career that the mother pushed the native towards.
3. Yes was probably married and met the person through sibling, neighbor or in community. I don't believe that the native had children.  Their mother was probably the person that taught them social work and was probably their closest friend, she was intelligent. Their father was probably a determined leader that was stable and responsible with their siblings, extended family, community, neighborhood. Their father taught them responsible communications/mindset when the native was young. The native probably did have a good strong relationship with their father. 

Totally stumped on who this could be. I can tell you they were born Jan 21 or 22, 1946.  Depending upon location of birth that is why I said 21 or 22. (I used Neptune to see potential date)"

Thanks for keeping the practicum going!!!"
10usyl2,j7wdgjv,Frogchairy,2023-02-09 21:40:37,2,"**\*\*\* All of my answers are based on the WHOLE SIGNS chart! \*\*\***

**Personality:** Most notable in this chart is the Lilith conjunct the AC. Any planet here has a significant impact on the physical appearance and character temperament of the native. As someone who studies Hellenic astrology, I don’t have a lot of experience with Litlith… but from the small knowledge of it that I do have, I think it would make this person rather immediately magnetic or bold. 

Lilith is like a big middle finger to the patriarchy. She is a self-assured woman aligned with her own sexual powers. On the AC, the native could have been very attractive and sexual. It’s kind of giving Marylin Monroe (although I know this isn’t her chart). A very girl boss placement. This native is probably very straightforward and often spoke against authority.

Anyway- Capricorn sun in the 3H… this person found their sense of self in local community. If they had siblings, they were probably very close (or at least very prominent/important). They probably found themselves in communal roles like some neighborhood watch shit or something. The Capricorn energy makes them feel most themselves when they are succeeding and when they are helping others around them to succeed (3H). 

Certainly someone who loves to raise others up (not kick them back down). Having established support systems is important to them and they enjoy supporting others. This person was certainly involved in creating shared space and reliable relationships. And they were good at it! Venus and Mercury are here with the sun too. Probably a likeable and pleasant person. 

**Career:** Pluto in the 10H ruled by Leo! This gives them a huge magnetic dramatic public perception and influence! This person (weather it was good or bad) certainly received a lot of public attention! Leo in 10H can often indicate being known for self expression (usually art). I’m sure this native has a great stage presence!

Their MC is in the 11H (in whole signs), and is conjunct with the moon in virgo! This is probably a good indicator of someone who worked with their friends for a living. Like potentially, they literally went into business with a friend or ended up becoming great friends with their coworkers and the work they did was very centered around community. With the virgo aspect here, and the moon, they had a lot of empathy for others. They wanted to be of service to others and help organize community resources and such.

The planetary ruler of this MC and moon is Mercury, which is placed in Capricorn 3H. So obviously this person played big roles, both personally and in career) in creating structure and organizing for community.

**Relationships:** The 7H ruler is Venus, and she is placed in the 3H. This would indicate meeting someone in a familiar setting. Maybe they met in a cafe that the native frequented regularly, or maybe they knew this person from childhood! Perhaps they met at school. This is a nocturnal chart so Venus has the upper hand, but maybe doesn’t have the best condition. Her domicile lord is Saturn, to whom she is opposed, so she might get some help but is not really going to always have the resources she needs to be successful often. 

Generally speaking though, I would say this person had a relatively good/average love life. I don’t see anything TOO crazy happening here. Maybe their romantic relationships struggled due to travel. I could see some long-distance relationship issues here (Saturn is the planet of limitation, in the house of foreign travel).

I don’t see anything indicating no children or significant difficulty with them. The IC is placed here, so this could probably be an indicator of coming from a big family with lots of kids. This house is ruled by Pisces which is the domicile of Jupiter. Jupiter in the 5H is always a good indicator of fertility. But in general, it doesn't really look like it was clear if they had kids or not. 

If they did, they probably had multiple and they had a good relationship with them! Jupiter in the 12H could indicate being isolated from their children. Or perhaps the 12H Jupiter means that they had plenty of 1 on 1 time with their kids. Maybe they went camping a bunch and spent a lot of time in physical isolation with their kids. 

**Death:** Probably an average death… The ruler of the 8H is Mercury, whom is placed in the 3H. They probably died in a rather common way in a familiar place. The domicile lord of mercury here is Saturn, so potentially death of old age or chronic illness. Nothing dramatic! Maybe organ failure or something.

**Guess:** I usually don’t have a clue who the native is until they are revealed, but I have a good feeling about this one. Is the native >!Dolly Parton!<???"
10usyl2,j80w9cn,2KatEyes,2023-02-10 20:24:32,2,"Hi - 

Some quick observations I'm looking at are the mars/saturn cancer opposite venus capricorn; maybe he is known for aggressive or even criminal behavior- perhaps toward women or a woman.  This aggressive nature is accentuated by the square to Jupiter.. a tendency toward excess and self-indulgence.  Yet he is likely a workaholic (3 Cap planets and Sun in3rd) .

The poor sensitive Virgo moon, at the top of the chart, and with no major aspects makes me think of someone who's seen as critical but self-effacing .. or like his fame is not widespread, but perhaps appeals to a certain genre? Or perhaps he had a difficult time getting noticed in his career, at least at first.

I see further down in the thread you say he is in movies/tv.. though i would have first guessed something darker with the above placements and the Scorpio rising, haha. So then I'd guess he writes or directs films ...maybe crime dramas?"

It's hard to know how someone prefers to bond with a partner without them explicitly saying so, but just based on what the native has put out, I wouldn't be surprised if intellectual exchange was a big part of it.

The native does not work in humanitarian- or service-based sectors, but they are absolutely known for their rather unique way of communicating! You're getting closer with your Pluto in Leo delineation- the native is not an actor, but keep pushing with that..."

This is very accurate!

Unfortunately those are not the fields that the native's career is in!

Really interesting with your Lilith interpretation. I also don't have the strongest understanding of this asteroid, but I could see this coming through with the native being somewhat comfortable with bringing taboo topics to the fore (especially in Scorpio). Although I suppose this could also be directed at their Pluto in the 10H. The native is male, fwiw!

Reading about the native's life, he was highly influenced by one particular place of residence that they lived in as an adult!

He did indeed meet one of his wives in school!

Yes to the native's Pluto in Leo pointing to one hell of a stage presence, and known for the self-expression in their art form. I don't think the native has been particularly focused on community building.

The native has indeed had multiple marriages and multiple children!

Not sure yet about the native's death as he's still alive! ;)

With mercury working through the northeast of the chart and in concert with the moon it could be regular, ritual output like anticipating the next thing after being satisfied in the conclusion of the last.

Is the work promote some kind of sense of lost justice in a way? Like keeping the conversation alive? Or bringing justice to the past by talking about it today? Some riff on these ideas?"

I looked up Dolly Partons chart, and it's almost IDENTICAL! These two people must have been born just minutes apart!

111czys,j8ea5gr,weareglenn,2023-02-13 17:55:52,15,Practicum is very manageable with another class & simulation is organized & a reasonable course in terms of workload. I think no matter how you stack the two over two semesters you will be fine - I think this comes down to a personal choice. Do you want a free summer for some vacation time? Do you want to spread it out over two semesters so you're never too stressed all at once? No wrong answers.
111czys,j8fq1fm,extrapolation_expert,2023-02-13 23:38:52,5,"I'll add my voice.. have done both CDA and Sim, with Sim in Summer and CDA in fall.

Sim was easier and less work than CDA because of the programming aspect, but also because there was less dense material. A lot of the math components come from MLE and probabilities, but if you have done CDA and other courses you have familiarity with the content, which should make it easier for you to follow the math again.

A lot of math challenges I found was from understanding probabilities, but the Prof and TA team are fantastic. The lectures tend to repeat a lot of stuff, which is good since the repetition helps reinforce the material.

And the problem sets are completely doable. In fact they are pretty essential in doing the exams well.

I agree with people in saying you can probably do both Sim and the practicum in the Summer."
111czys,j8enl90,kimbabs,2023-02-13 19:23:43,2,"If you have a 4.0 after CDA while working, I think you'll be fine and kudos to you. Don't have too much to contribute, but I have heard simulation is ~~more programming than math~~, and that the practicum is pretty much however you want to define it. I'll be in the same boat as you next semester.

I feel you on the math thing. I dropped DO this semester after peeking over the slides since I struggled through CDA and work is picking up this semester. I want to really understand optimization and refresh my lin alg/calc, but it's not something I'd be able to practice at work. 

Leaves me feeling like a fraud, but I've been feeling like what I'm learning is being lost since all I do is regressions at work. I'm even considering delaying graduating to try and get more experience or into another job that I can feel like I'm applying my knowledge in.

Edit: I was wrong, sorry"

Best advice to pass Sim is to pickup his book, A First Course in Probability and Statistics. Read through that and complete the exercises and I guarantee you will breeze through the course.

Try not to get bogged down by an off-day teaching (we all have them - where lessons don’t land well or go how you planned), focus on the positive parts of your day and make this a practice going forward.

But after placement I went back once a week to spend a day in their class just as a volunteer and it was suddenly just a tone and my AT & I got along super well. Weirdly enough, it can just the fact that you’re in placement and being observed that can throw some people off. 

You’re not in an environment that you created so it’s hard to feel at home, but the feeling goes away once you can start building your class more. Sorry for not offering any specific advice but I can tell you that you’ll feel much better with time!"

Communicate with your associate teacher: If you're worried about doing something wrong or overstepping, it may help to have a conversation with your associate teacher. Explain your concerns and ask for clarification on what is expected of you. This will also give you an opportunity to ask for feedback and suggestions on how you can improve.

Focus on your goals: Remember why you became a teacher in the first place and what your goals are. Focus on your passion for teaching and the impact you hope to have on your students. This will help you keep your stress in perspective and give you a reason to push through the challenges.

Take care of yourself: Practicum can be demanding, so it's important to take care of yourself physically and mentally. Make time for exercise, eating well, and getting enough sleep. Practice self-care and find ways to relieve stress, such as meditation or mindfulness exercises.

Practice mindfulness: Try to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the future or regrets about the past. When you're teaching, concentrate on the students and what you're doing in the moment, rather than worrying about what your associate teacher thinks of you.

Seek support: Finally, don't be afraid to reach out to others for support. Talk to friends, family, or classmates who are also in the same situation. They may be able to offer you encouragement and advice.

Remember, everyone goes through a learning curve and makes mistakes. The most important thing is to keep learning, growing, and developing as a teacher. Good luck!"

There are some universal best practices but it’s nearly impossible to incorporate them all, all of the time, in a system that is under-funded and lacks meaningful resources. Do this job because you love it. Make learning meaningful to your students. Have fun teaching every day. When you’re done with teacher’s college you’ll get to have your own way of teaching… and you’re almost there. Teachers college is a lot of hoop jumping, busy work, and theory.

The ones who do speak may not be refusing to speak, but they may be in an environment where they don’t feel comfortable or able to speak (not saying it’s anything you’ve done- but it’s not uncommon). Child led therapy is going to be pretty essential. I would highly recommend letting them play with whatever seems fun to them and copying them, showing genuine excitement for their interests alongside them. You’d be amazed with how much kids will open up and show communication skills when you just hang out with them with no pressure. And also, the more you take pressure off *yourself* to feel like you need to target goals with every move you make, the more relaxed they’ll probably be! I know that’s all pretty nebulous but it’s honestly remarkable how much child-led therapy changes the game."

1. ""The verbal ones refuse, I mean REFUSE, to speak""
2. ""If they do speak...we ignore them""

I'm very familiar with the population you're describing. For the ones who speak sometimes, everyone and their uncle like to make comments such as ""They can talk, they just don't want to"", ""They're just being lazy"", etc. And then turn around and don't acknowledge their communication attempts. Lot to unpack here but it's important to remember that if they COULD, they very likely WOULD. Not speaking is not making their life easier. In fact it's making it much more difficult. Instead of ""refusing to talk"", I think of it as their speech is not reliable, and they can't consistently generate what they want to express. You got some great suggestions in the comments already. I know you're new, no judgment here, just be aware of the way you're perceiving and responding to these kids and their skills."

Spin them in a spinning chair, bounce on a peanut ball, find a sensory swing, jump on a trampoline. Regulate regulate regulate. Don’t ignore echolalia. Echolalia communicates! Focus on that connection and they will let you into their world instead of feeling like you are on different planets. Their eyes will light up and they’ll look at you like “you get me!” and it will be so beautiful it’ll make you cry (it does me at least) 

When regulation needs and engagement are met, THEN you can start to look at developing those language skills. Skip PECS and find a robust AAC system. Model model model without expectation. Remember that there are other functions of communication besides only requesting. Figure out what they’re interested in and what THEY want to talk about"

Building relationships is a huge part of working with ASD children. Honestly, there are some sessions where I can’t get any data at all, even when I’ve been working with them for almost 3 years. Some days are good, some are bad. A lot of therapy for kids with autism is using behavior techniques, sensory needs, and relationship building.

I tell all my students, we are teaching/helping kids to communicate, not to do tricks. Watch out for methods of therapy that create or enforce prompt dependence. Also, get AAC devices into their hands as quickly as you can."
10ryydr,j6zuy9c,turquoise_moonlight,2023-02-03 01:35:17,12,"I’d also check out gestalt language/natural language acquisition as there are some great ideas for supporting early stages of communication including ensuring children have access to robust AAC. If you are in a school then SCERTS could help you and teaching staff to work on developing supportive communication partner strategies.  Your interest and desire to help is great, keep going!!"

I recommend play-based child led therapy where you are modeling lots if functional gestalts!"
10ryydr,j6ynptl,notA-studentvisa,2023-02-02 20:41:08,6,"Hi, I sympathize with you! I understand how difficult these clients can be.

I’d recommend sensory toys- dry rice, those jelly beads, or slime, You can add little toys in as well. Put it in a closed container big enough that they can put both hands in. With this you can work on the signs “more” and “open” let them have their alone time with and use this request. 


There’s toys in my clinic that all my nonverbal kids enjoy, it’s an elephant that shoots plastic balls using air. You can use this to teach “put in, more, help, all done” you can turn the air off to “sabotage” and again, work on “more”"
10ryydr,j701kpg,AspenSky2,2023-02-03 02:25:27,5,"Laura Mize has amazing resources for clients with this level of differences. Her workbook Teach Me To Play With You is something I use every day . Helping our kids tune in first before anything else is so very important . Her checklist -11 skills  need to master before first words also is a game changer!  It helps us see what is emerging , what is not there yet or what that have mastered .  Helps with functional goal writing too 👍🏻🎉. If you want more tools and info DM me 😊"
10ryydr,j74l9ii,estelle_blake,2023-02-04 00:51:46,1,"I would encourage you to consider different modes of communication. AAC is the bridge after all :) and can be low tech! Also sign is great. Even if it’s as simple as “more” and “all done” and that’s all you work on! 

Bubbles are a magical thing also 🤣 my kids love watching them fall. Streamers are good too! Anything shiny and that moves. Or food is a great motivator too!"
10ryydr,j6zff6q,tinyladyduck,2023-02-02 23:41:06,15,"This! I have a student who is mostly echolalic, and every session I’ve just been following him around the classroom. Nothing I’ve tried to engage him with has worked for more than about 30 seconds. The other day he ended up grabbing some toys, and I noticed there was a red, yellow, and green one. I ended up playing red light/green light with him. He didn’t get it at first and then it clicked. When we paused and I stood up, he came over, reached up and looked at me, and said, “Sit down?” That was how he requested continuation, and I was STOKED!"
10ryydr,j7042wd,nonny313815,2023-02-03 02:44:39,10,"This, I've found, is really key. Even kids who *seem* like they're not engaging with you or paying attention to you absolutely are. They easily pick up on whether somebody likes them and wants to be with and around them vs somebody who's just there to get them to perform. They needed that connection and unconditional positive regard and safety before they'll actually be able to learn anything from you."
10ryydr,j6zoe2b,texmom3,2023-02-03 00:45:44,11,"Yes, this! I also hope they have AAC supports."
10ryydr,j6zzu61,Carmen_CarMel,2023-02-03 02:12:24,4,"Oh no, I meant ignoring them as in we'll be whispering to each other or writing in our notes. And all of a sudden there's spontaneous speech, or they say their versión of whatever the target word/phrase was. And it feels like that's the only time they speak when we aren't asking/looking for them too. But yes, you're right I have to be aware of my approach. But when we do hear speech we go yay, and good talking etc. Try to reinforce and expand where possible. And yea, you got the parents to a tee which makes us feel worse. Cuz were all: yayyy, and they go: he says that all the time at home 😕"
10ryydr,j7002jw,Carmen_CarMel,2023-02-03 02:14:12,2,"Thank you, when you say skip PECS may I ask why? Only because this very question came up last week where a parent was very heavily insisting on a full device and we were wondering if we should start with PECS before overwhelming the client."
10ryydr,j6zzait,Carmen_CarMel,2023-02-03 02:08:18,1,Some of them are in a school actually and the principal is super focused on their IEP goals being targeted. So I'll deff check these out. Thanks so much.
10ryydr,j6yrut7,Carmen_CarMel,2023-02-02 21:06:36,2,Thanks a lot for the sensory tip. I have an elephant that shoots butterflies. Lol ill get those batteries tonight!
10ryydr,j703cy1,lemonringpop,2023-02-03 02:39:03,13,"Okay! Yup, you hit the nail on the head. You can facilitate spontaneous language by taking a step back. Model without expectation, don’t prompt them to repeat or respond. Leave room for silence to give them time to process and generate more language. Instead of “good talking” and similar comments, try acknowledging by repeating what they say, modelling what you think they’re trying to say, or simply saying “yeah” or “mhmm”. Then you can model your own comment about what they’re doing/what’s happening. It’s not necessary to keep up a constant stream of modelling and bombarding them with language, and can actually be counterproductive."
10ryydr,j705795,nonny313815,2023-02-03 02:53:23,6,"What's their reaction when you try to reinforce? Do they make more attempts? Or are they just shutting down again? (I'm going to assume they shut down again since it seems like you don't get much of a response after that...)

For me, I've also found that if a child has a negative reaction to what NT people think of as ""positive verbal reinforcement,"" then we can't really consider it a positive reinforcer for that child. What might be more rewarding is to just respond casually, more like you would to a peer. For instance, if you were playing with bubbles, you disengaged and talked with a coworker, and you hear a kid say ""bubbles,"" you might want to say something like, ""oh, I noticed you said bubbles. Were you thinking about the bubbles we just played with? They were pretty fun."" And then see how they respond to that. Maybe they want more bubbles, maybe they don't, but just watch their reactions to your casual engagement with their communication attempts. (I also agree with others that robust AAC is probably gonna be pretty handy.)"
10ryydr,j70fdkd,apatiksremark,2023-02-03 04:16:43,3,"That's how all my non talking twos are like.  Parents say they notice a difference at home and that their kid is starting to talk, however when the kid gets to therapy they don't say anything.  Usually I just say that I would rather the child be talking in their regular environment than in a 30-minute session in the clinic if I had to choose. 

I chalk it up to nerves, unfamiliarity of the environment, and the child listening to what I have to say to them.  So I play, and I talk, and I act out scenarios all so that maybe the child will pick up the language that I'm demonstrating.  

But they will surprise you.  You have a non-talker who comes in one day saying ""go"" and then a couple months later is saying the whole alphabet and counting to 10 while signing and singing each word loving every minute of therapy."
10ryydr,j70al1e,joa-kolope,2023-02-03 03:36:27,2,But do they really? I’ve asked parents to record it and they never are able to.

10ryydr,j703mck,lil89,2023-02-03 02:41:03,6,"Came here to say this. Many autistic children are gestalt language processors which means that they learn in units and not single words. It is important to follow their lead and model scripts they can use. Please follow @meaningfulspeech on instagram. 

An autistic person can still be a gestalt language processor if they are not speaking. It is important to get students robust AAC as soon as possible and start modeling. 

If there are no robust devices, introduce communication boards with core words and phrases. Model with no expectation, do not use hand over hand or prompt them to respond. They will engage when they are comfortable and regulated."

\*knuckle crack\*

1. Personality - Looking to the native's 1H and AC, both of which are ruled by Virgo, with their Mercury in Aries in their 8H (and retrograde!). I would guess that the native would be somewhat compulsive, with Virgo's talents towards the detailed and the constructive melding with Aries' drive and brashness. Especially with the native's luminary in sect, the Sun, exalted in Aries as well, I would think that the Aries propulsive quality would be quite apparent, perhaps most especially in the native's speech. Mercury's placement in the 8H and it's significations of death, inheritance, and the assets of others (which I've taken from the keywords that The Astrology Podcast provides) suggests that perhaps an aspect of the native's life revolved around these topics. Maybe an inheritance or financial windfall of a partner defined their marriage or they created art that dealt with conceptions of death, just as a few ideas. The ruler of the AC being in a house that is in aversion to the 1H might point to the native having a hard time fully grasping who they are, or dealing with conflicting qualities in themselves without being able to balance or reconcile. I'm not quite sure how to read a ruler of the 1H being in retrograde, but my guess would be that either the native's energy and expression were more frequently directed inwards to their inner world rather than outwards into the external world, or that some aspect of their life revolved around reflecting on and going over some particular event, maybe from their early life or even before they were born.
2. Relationships - For marriage, looking to the native's 7H, which is ruled by Pisces. Their Jupiter is in their Aquarius-ruled 6H. This, to me, would suggest that the native's immediate relationships are somewhat progressive for the time, perhaps in reimagining structures (with their Jupiter squaring their Saturn) and boundaries (with their 7H ruled by Pisces, as well as their Jupiter in opposition to their Neptune) beyond the cultural norm. I could see the native being polyamorous, for example, which might be further supported by the Moon and exalted Venus in their 7H (dreamlike melding) and Uranus closely conjunct their DC (inventiveness). For friends, the condition of their 7H applies, and in addition looking to the native's 11H ruled by Cancer with their aforementioned Moon in Pisces in their 7H. The native's Pluto is in their 11H and is in a fairly tight trine with their Moon. These connections between the 7H and 11H, to me, further support the native engaging with a relationship structure that involves more than one person, like consensual polyamory or nonconsensual adultery. For children, looking to the native's 5H ruled by Capricorn, with their Saturn retrograde in their 3H ruled by Scorpio. Again, I'm not exactly sure how to incorporate the planet being retrograde, but I would think that this placement otherwise signifies the native having kids later in life or perhaps encountering obstacles in their fertility but ultimately being successful.
3. For career, looking to the native's 10H containing their MC ruled by Gemini, with their aforementioned Mercury in Aries. The combination of Aries and Gemini seems very ""kinesthetic communication"" to me, so I might guess that they were involved in something like acting, stand-up, wrestling, etc. With their 10H/MC ruler in the 8H, I would again guess that something about their work was tied with death, as either a tangible or conceptual theme, or the resources of others, like something that they inherited. Perhaps their career and notoriety was even in the shadow of a parent's.
4. With so many of their placements concentrated in the right side of their chart, specifically their 6H, 7H, and 8H, I would think that a main theme of their life was in their direct relationships- employees, romantic interests, and parents. (That feels really general, like those are big themes in pretty much everyone's lives, but their life and notoriety were somehow centered on these.) 
5. I'm not sure how to read for cause of death in the chart (somewhat intentionally, I don't know if I'd do well with that kind of information) but at a glance, I could see the native's Mars placement in the 6H manifesting as a sudden illness or surgery when activated by a transit, progression, or profection."

10htejh,j5dzwz8,Active_Doctor,2023-01-22 08:25:49,3,"When I click on the image for this chart, it only shows the lower half. Can't answer the questions"
10htejh,j5p47s9,MaMaMaMainer707,2023-01-24 16:19:47,3,"I am new here this is an amazing way to test this, so Do we list our answers or keep them to self ?"
10htejh,j6lf6c2,Frogchairy,2023-01-31 03:44:26,3,"**Personality:** The Sun and Mercury (chart ruler) in Aries in the 8H! The sun is the sect light of the chart and it is exalted in Aries, thus it is of good condition and thus an indicator of a confident person! Given that they had these placements in the 8H, they probably found their sense of self in the things that most other people don’t often think about. The 8H is visible from the AC, but it is hidden to the 7H. Thus perhaps they knew themselves well, but others didn’t. Given that Mercury is the chart ruler and it is in-sect as a diurnal Mercury, this native had some strong ideas. As a retrograde mercury in the 8H, I think the native struggled to get their ideas understood. I think they were a good communicator, but other people couldn’t get behind their ideas and the native often felt misunderstood when they tried to express themselves. Additionally, with Uranus on the DC, they probably tried to find other people with equally radical/strong ideas about the world. Venus (exalted, and with its sect light) and Moon in Pisces in the 7H, would indicate a socially affluent person. These planets are out of sect, so perhaps not always an easy time for them, but generally, they had great social success. Probably very pretty, charming, and well liked. They were likely calm and easygoing and potentially a great listener via their extension of compassion towards all.   


\-

**Relationships:** With the ruler of the 7H in the 6H, somehow the physical health of the native is tied to their relationships / partnerships. Perhaps their relationships put strain on them and their health. Perhaps they were being abused in some capacity? (although I doubt that actually given that the ruler is jupiter and venus is exalted)... Could also be that their physical health affected their relationships. With aquarius and pisces ruling the 6H and 7H, maybe there could have some kind of “caretaking” and shared burden situations going on here… idl. I’m not really sure what to make of this placement yet. Also, their venus is not aspected, thus has no support from the rest of the chart… They might have struggled in romantic relationships specifically. They have north node and pluto in 11H. They desperately wanted friends and were always looking for that sense of collective belonging, and perhaps they were able to find that. The ruler of the 11H is the moon in the 7H, and the moon is trine to the pluto. So perhaps their friendships were valuable and meaningful. As for children, the 5H is ruled by saturn, saturn is relatively poorly placed in scorpio and squared jupiter. Probably had children later in life or even no kids at all. Maybe some fertility issues…? If they had kids, they were not a very important part of their life, at least nothing special. Could have had a hard time relating/connecting with their children. Perhaps they weren’t able to bond over any shared interests.   


\-

**Career:** Virgo AC and Gemini MC… I feel like this person was a great communicator and had a lot of charm, but their work still went unnoticed… Or they were some kind of speaker or even martyr who used their voice, but were often misunderstood. They message probably got lots of attention and their words were seen in the public eye, but never really caught on in the way that they wanted it to….? Some possible careers could be journalist, politician, organizer, performer, actor, public figure, etc.? Ruler in 8H so maybe someone who worked with death or inheritance or other people's money??? I’m really not sure with this career question.   


\-

**Themes:** Sect leader (sun) and chart ruler (diurnal mercury) in the 8H indicates to me that this person had a hard time being respected/valued/appreciated by others. They probably felt isolated from others (as the 8H is in aversion and hidden to the 7H). The Chiron here in the 8H also indicates the same I think. The native wanted to be celebrated and they were not. The chiron wound probably made them feel like they never got the attention they deserved. They wanted to play, and they were never played with… I think the 3H scorpio saturn plays into this more. Even when they were young and at school with peers, they struggled to be heard. They were probably very smart but didn’t do well in their early years… If we look at house rulership, the 6H and the 3H have mutual reception, and then the 8H, 7H and 6H are all connected too. There was a lot going on over here…   


\-

**Death:** Ruler of the 8H is Mars which is placed in the 6H. Mars is of a poor condition (out of sect, in a diurnal sign, in aversion to moon, and rising before the moon) thus it is uncomfortable and likely to act up. This would indicate a quick death. Could either be a violent accident or an aggressive illness! Given Jupiters placement in the 6H (planet of growth), perhaps the native had cancerous growths! The location of the cancer could probably be in the head/face/brain (aries) or around the legs/ankles or in the bones (aquarius). If not cancer, another illness to these regions or maybe an injury to these parts of the body. The ruler of the 6H is Saturn and in the 3H. This would represent restrictions in this area… I’m out on a limb here, but maybe this would mean that they didn’t receive the attention that they needed. So maybe they suffered an accident, but the ambulance didn’t arrive fast enough or the hospital wasn’t able to provide the necessary care and the native passed away due to not being able to access the local resources they needed.

10htejh,j640kqf,ghosteegoo,2023-01-27 15:42:33,3,"Very nice! 
And overall pretty on point! 😁 

1. I'd say this is very accurate, the only note I'd make is look another aspect of the 8th house, it's hardly addressed in the astrology podcast but it's there but you're definitely on the right track there!

2. This one was spot on, 10/10! Native had many..many lovers and multiple lovers at once! 

3. This one is again on the right track, just make the other 8H connection, I do enjoy the kinesthetic communication and acting/stand up/wrestling is so just right there like almost but not quite, it'll be funny when the native's revealed and you see what I mean! 🤭 But again very good!

4. No not general at all, you're actually on point with this one too like with question 2! The natives main theme of their life was their many lovers so absolutely!

5. Very good on this one as well, the native died from a sudden illness! 

Beautiful work! 😍"

117h2ho,j9bvenx,TheSukis,2023-02-20 20:03:32,5,"Not sure about Canada, but they are unpaid in the US.  You'll receive a stipend during your internship year, however."
117h2ho,j9cklpr,MaronKun,2023-02-20 22:50:50,3,"After my interviews with some Canadian programs, for the most part, they are unpaid, however, sometimes paid opportunities exists but very rare. It's not something you can reliably expect, and as you can imagine that if its available, that practicum is likely very competitive among the students in your cohort so you can never be sure you'll get it even if available."
117h2ho,j9cszai,Attempted_Academic,2023-02-20 23:50:17,3,I’m in the GTA and all of our external practicums are unpaid. My program has three practicums before internship but all are 2-3 days a week. So it sucks that student work is often exploited but it won’t be like the 65 unpaid hours a week you’re doing now.
117h2ho,j9epue4,spiciestnug,2023-02-21 11:26:59,1,"I will say it’s possible to get paid but very unlikely. One of my classmates started as an unpaid extern and then got hired on at the end of their time so works for the company for a pay rate while doing a new clinical site for free. Sometimes you can work out supervised experience where you already work if you work in the field. This is fairly rare, though. So possible, but highly unlikely."
117h2ho,j9fn30a,Mentaculus9,2023-02-21 16:06:48,1,"I get paid half of my fees for my current practicum, but I was unpaid during my first one. I don’t know if anyone else in my entire program who is paid, so it’s rare. I had no idea I was going to be paid when I interviewed, the psychologist who owns the place asked me how half of me fees sounded and I was totally confused. I also get paid based on the assessments I administer. This is extremely rare and only because the person supervising me is a really generous guy and says it’s good for my professional development to deal with client payment, but also that I’m working and deserve to be paid for work."
117h2ho,j9fwtgl,FalseDamage13,2023-02-21 17:10:15,1,Some Canadian schools have rules against paid practicums. I was offered a stipend for mine and the school made such a big deal about it that I had to find a new one.
117h2ho,j9dnq1p,InsufficientGouda,2023-02-21 03:49:04,0,"Not paid. Agencies can’t bill for practicum students’ clinical time (at least not in US), and the cost of supervision and training are high. In other words, practicum students cost a lot more money than they generate. If we had to pay them on top of all the extant costs, we’d go bankrupt!"
117h2ho,j9cqr19,Terrible_Detective45,2023-02-20 23:34:02,2,"They're sometimes paid in the US, but they're the minority by a significant margin."
117h2ho,j9hrwfe,RatPumpkin,2023-02-22 01:42:41,1,"Oof! That’s so upsetting! Do you get a stipend from the school for the PhD/program itself, is the program funded or are you paying out of pocket for enrolment?"
117h2ho,j9crppx,TheSukis,2023-02-20 23:41:02,1,In what state?  That's not something that I've ever encountered in Massachusetts.
117h2ho,j9csbot,Terrible_Detective45,2023-02-20 23:45:31,1,Many different states. I have colleagues who attended grad school around the country and were paid for some of their practica.
117h2ho,j9csie3,TheSukis,2023-02-20 23:46:53,1,"Interesting.  I didn't encounter that in New York either, but I didn't mention New York since I'm less familiar with things there.

If someone were to ask about payment for a practicum in Massachusetts they would unfortunately be laughed right out of the room."
117h2ho,j9cthvl,Terrible_Detective45,2023-02-20 23:54:06,1,"I mean, it's not the case that you would ask the prac supervisor to pay, but rather the standing policy of that practicum to pay students. It's more likely to happen in private practice, though some that are clinical research through the VA or AMCs also pay for grad students to be the interventionists."
117h2ho,j9cu3k0,TheSukis,2023-02-20 23:58:30,1,"Right, I was just referring to the general idea of payment for practicum placements.  That would be so against the norm here that people would think it's a ridiculous concept."
117h2ho,j9g9q8m,Avacado_Toast6,2023-02-21 18:32:12,1,"In the US, I have only known one practicum site that offered any kind of stipend."

As part of their learning practicum, each student must research and film a short review video to pass. This is Jason's review of the Yugoslavian Zastava M76. 😎🎥

Check out our YouTube channel for past student reviews.

\------

On Thursday, November 17th, several members of the CFA team were invited by Marstar Canada 🇨🇦 to visit their facility and learn about the history of Cold War firearms development. 🧐🤔📖🎬

Under the supervision of Marstar Canada staff, the CFA filmed several educational firearms videos on selected firearms in their working collection.

This educational partnership with Marstar Canada provides students with an opportunity to research and have hands-on experience with unique firearms.

**Note:** All prohibited firearms/devices are registered and shot under staff supervision."

10qkhgg,j6qtys9,jaymich17,2023-02-01 06:07:14,8,"Hi, I just started my practicum last week and had all the same concerns as you. It’s totally normal to feel this way when you’re new at something. My site supervisor is easing me in pretty slowly - my first day all I did was observation of her counseling sessions and observe students in classes and at lunch time. During my second week I got to “counsel” a student by playing a social emotional learning game with them and spent the rest of the day mainly observing. Know that the first few weeks you will be learning a lot, so ask questions, write things down. Starting practicum is like starting a new job or starting grad school — nobody is an expert on day 1, you’ll probably make a few mistakes, but the purpose of you being there is to learn and gain experience. If you do come across any issues or you don’t feel the anxiety subsiding, talk to your site supervisor or advisor or even peers."
10qkhgg,j6qm8rn,Sereyn,2023-02-01 04:49:11,5,"I'm not sure what program you're in, but based on my experience, your site will likely gradually give you responsibilities. They know that you're still an intern (+ I assume you're not there all week and won't have time to take on all of a school counselor's responsibilities) and will probably account for that.

You're in the program for a reason and you can handle it! But if everything feels overwhelming, it's important to voice your concerns and set professional boundaries. :)"
10qkhgg,j6qr1ad,Bright_Tradition_711,2023-02-01 05:35:56,3,"Wow, I feel like I could’ve written this. I am not at the point you are yet but I would say keep going. You will regret not giving it a shot especially if you made it this far. I think it’s easy to get cold feet based off others experiences and in these moments you should remember everyone’s experience is different. As the person above commented, they should ease you into it. I hope to see more insightful responses for future reference. Goodluck!!!"
10qkhgg,j6sf4g3,bree2120,2023-02-01 15:53:47,3,"It’s scary to literally everyone. But what they teach you in class is not what we do in the real world. Use TPT for lessons. Those are easy, especially if you’re in the elementary school. Your supervisor knows you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re brand new. They will help you"
10qkhgg,j6tyyty,thebeeskeys5,2023-02-01 21:37:08,2,"I agree with all that was written here. So much is learned in practicum and it is different from class, I don't think practicum advisors expect you to start teaching anything on your own! I am sending you positive thoughts on your first day, hang in there!!!"
10qkhgg,j6vv134,tball788,2023-02-02 06:23:46,2,"I don’t know what kind of person you are and what kind of encouragement you will need but I will tell you what I tell myself when I have to do something I particularly don’t want to do. 

“Take the next step, get it done, repeat, and at the end of the day if anything bad happened, it will be over with.”"
10qkhgg,j6rhapi,Schmittywerminson,2023-02-01 11:15:36,2,Your words make me feel a bit better. I just have to shake off some self doubt. My only other big concern is my site supervisor is known to be a bit all over the place and doesn’t know the difference between Practicum and internship so he may try to just throw me into situations on the first day. I’ve had other people tell me he’s a flexible guy and to just speak up if that’s not what I want so I guess I’ll have to try to advocate for myself.
10qkhgg,j6rh3dv,Schmittywerminson,2023-02-01 11:12:59,2,Thank you so much for the encouragement. It’s nice to know I’m not alone.
10qkhgg,j6wm51h,Schmittywerminson,2023-02-02 12:20:34,1,I’m gonna keep that in mind. That helps thank you :)
10qkhgg,j6sfk9c,bree2120,2023-02-01 15:56:33,3,"This sounds crazy but being thrown into it is the best way to learn. You’ll surprise yourself with how well you handle it. As a school counselor, I face new situations every week and sometimes I have to wing it. This is a field that you will never be perfect in because it involves several different people who aren’t perfect around you (ie students, teachers, parents)"

10qkhgg,j6u8uqk,Schmittywerminson,2023-02-01 22:41:08,1,Ugh it’s so intimidating at first. I’ll just have to trust myself and not beat myself up if I mess up here and there
10qkhgg,j71eg7g,Schmittywerminson,2023-02-03 11:21:11,1,It went okay. My supervisor just threw me into this thing called the hub that they have at the high school I’m at. Students go there on their free periods or lunch to hang out. So I was in there just talking to students and playing games which was fun but I do want to do more than that. I’m going to have to advocate for myself to do more stuff in his office too because he’s extremely hands off for a Practicum supervisor. I 100% am certain now though that I want to work with you her kids lol still a bit uncertain about specifically being a school counselor though
10qkhgg,j754m1h,tball788,2023-02-04 03:27:29,1,In a role like that I think you can find little things to do within the role of the counselor. “What are your plans after high school?” “Have you filled out FAFSA?” “What goals do you have for this year?”
101wadh,j2q0j8q,Attempted_Academic,2023-01-03 03:22:34,22,"I feel this to my core. I’m in the process of applying to my second external prac (we do four back-to back for four years) and the expectations of some of the sites are appalling. Of course all of the ones I’m the most interested in on paper seem to be the most exploitative. So I’m actually applying for sites that work with populations I have no interest in solely because the expectations are more realistic. Some site directors explicitly said that the want their students work through the summer (for free) and come in on extra days.  

Between full time course work, lab work, my job as a CRC, and volunteer work, my days are already 12+ hours long without prac. I seriously don’t know how I’m going to manage another three years of this."

The day I was offered the spot the owner said “so, does 50% of your fees work?” And I was like wtf I had no clue you paid your students. It gets me fired up when my classmates talk about not getting paid, it’s such bullshit.  I didn’t get paid at my first practicum but was offered a job there after and make way more than I would with my masters degree and no license alone, so I was happy to work in CMH my first few years out of my masters then get the job I have now plus the paid practicum. It’s absolutely exploitation that they don’t even through students a 20 or something for doing a therapy session. The psychologist who owns the practice where I’m a student taught in the program I’m in for almost 20 years and basically explained he thought it was unfair we didn’t get paid and that it’s good experience to have to talk to clients about payment."

This is a good example. None of those things by themselves or in combination are trauma, severe or otherwise. This is demeaning the lived experience of people who have experience real trauma. Just because something is very stressful doesn't mean it's trauma.

From the biggest expert on trauma: **Bessel van der Kolk**, M.D., defines trauma as “not the story of something that happened back then, but the current imprint of that pain, horror, and fear living inside [the individual].”

It’s a lasting emotional response that results from having lived through a distressing event or continued ongoing/recurring events (chronic in this latter case). These events leave us stuck in a state of helplessness and terror, and results in a change in how we perceive danger.
Repeated and recurring emotional abuse or neglect *IS* trauma. It is repeated identical or similar events that constitute a real threat of survival to the individual. In this later case this is not a “one time event” where the individual is reliving the past. It is repeated in the present.

10jnk9v,j5lr3mb,Kelso_sloane,2023-01-23 22:16:09,1,"I've reached out to several nonprofits in my area that provide free counseling. They all take interns, but only for 12 month placements. Unfortunately I'm in a rural area without a lot of options."
10jnk9v,j5ncdce,Katerina_VonCat,2023-01-24 05:28:55,2,Depends on the requirements. When I did mine none of those would count as direct client contact unfortunately.

10jnk9v,j5mnly5,cakesandkittens,2023-01-24 02:05:08,1,"Could you do a telehealth only practicum? I know it’s not ideal, but it could open up the options."
10jnk9v,j5nfxco,lil8mochi,2023-01-24 06:06:41,1,Sitting in on group therapy should count as direct hours. But yes it would depend on the requirements. I would hope at this point they would accommodate based on the lack of any site at this point tho.
10jnk9v,j5nhpj9,Katerina_VonCat,2023-01-24 06:26:41,2,"For mine and the licensing hours you had to actually be actively doing something in the group therapy not just sitting in the group. Same as other types of co-therapy. You had to actually be participating as a therapist vs just being in the space. So definitely depends on the practicum requirements and the state licensing ones.  My program was CACREP and I also did dual track and got the equivalency for MFTC as well (main campus was COAMFTE accredited, but my campus was not but did all the classes, prac, and internship). 

For making acceptions, unfortunately most places don’t. It’s either you do it or you take more time/another semester or however long it takes to complete it. Maybe some schools, but mine were sticklers for by the books."

At the end of the day, it's how kindly you take care of the patients and how dedicated you are to getting better at treating and diagnosing them every year that makes you good at your job.  At the beginning, you should be safe enough to treat your patients, meaning you aren't going to cause them harm because you will ask for help / not do treatments you know are over your head (like certain aspects of swallowing) until you are further trained.  It is so much; it's like drinking out of a fire hose regarding the knowledge you're expected to internalize in a short amount of time.  It's not you - it should really be more spread out learning-wise.

I felt that way and I got a lovely CF position and now I love my coworkers and boss and vice versa.  I work in a school with kids, but I feel confident now that if I wanted to switch to adults, I would know how and where to find the trainings and resources that would make that possible.

Acute care is hard--it's a complex setting with a lot of things to learn. Focus on growing fundamental skills. Talk with you supervisor about a specific skill or two at a time that you want to improve. If you aren't very comfortable doing oral mech exams, I'd focus on that first.   


It will get more comfortable, but it is definitely going to take time and exposure. That's what this experience is for--a chance to dip your toes in with what should be basically 100% supervision, support, and collaboration throughout the semester."

Give yourself some grace - supervisors don’t expect you to know everything - you are still a student 😊 What they do want it to see you learn and grow and ask questions .  Maybe let your supervisor know you learn best by reviewing previous notes or using them for a reference and then ask if he or she has suggestions .  

Also it might be helpful to review their expectations and yours are  as well as both of your communication styles .   Knowing this can really help both of you .  Don’t assume because they haven’t said anything , that you should or need to do or know something .  Remember too that they have accepted taking a student and are dedicated to mentoring you 😊 

We as SLPs are critical of ourselves and like to do things well .  One small thing we think didn’t go well can de-rail us.  So writing down what are the things you learned or something you did well does make a difference for our mental health ❤️."

1. Personality - The ruler of their Leo AC is the Sun, which they have in Cancer in their 12H. I would take from that an overall caring and warm person, but someone who was also difficult to get to know deeply: a very private, internal person. The Sun's conjunction with Neptune and co-presence with exalted Jupiter exaggerates these and might point to the native having either an idealized or fanciful conception of themselves, or what they show to others. I can see them portraying themselves almost like a fairytale version of their identity, but having a much deeper and more complex inner experience that even they themselves don't fully grasp. Their Sun and Neptune are also in a strong opposition to their Mars and Uranus, which are conjunct in their Capricorn-ruled 6H. I would take that as indicating that the native is prone to bursts of intensive focus and drive to work amid their more fluid, going-with-their-whims nature, and/or that pressures to work and produce feel frictional to them. They also have Mercury in Leo in their 1H, which highlights a warm communication style as integral to their identity, and may also point to a somewhat fluctuating presentation of self as well. Sometimes they were cheerful, sometimes they were moody.
2. Relationships - For romantic partners, their DC is in Aquarius ruled by Saturn, which is in Pisces in the 8H. Saturn is not strongly placed there, but is receiving a trine from exalted Jupiter in Cancer and a sextile from exalted Moon in Taurus, which I imagine helps. From this, I would guess that the native might have gotten married ""later"" (for the time period, at least, considering this person was born sometime between the late 1800s and early 1900s) but that the marriage was overall healthy. With Saturn in the 8H, perhaps the native's spouse contributed significantly to their financial situation. Looking at children, their 5H is ruled by Sagittarius, with its ruler Jupiter again exalted in Cancer in their 12H. I would think this bodes very well for having children. I wouldn't be surprised if they had multiple. Jupiter is also close to conjuncting the native's N Node, which makes me think that marriage and children brought about great changes to the native's life in some way (I mean they do for everyone, but the N Node's placement suggests that it might have been a more sudden or greater upheaval than for most). For friends, their one-on-one close relationships are covered by their DC and Saturn in Pisces; for other friends or larger circles, looking to their 11H ruled by Gemini with their Mercury in Leo in the 1H. This makes me think that larger social circles were of great importance to the native, especially how the circles perceived the native. A social butterfly who greatly enjoyed somewhat surface level interactions with swaths of friends. The native has Venus and Pluto conjunct one another in their 11H which is also squaring their Pisces Saturn. I read this as a desire for union, subsumption, on the part of the native which ran counter to or aggravated the native's marriage and parenthood dynamics. I could see this indicating multiple affairs (so maybe I am rescinding my assessment that the marriage was healthy!).
3. Career - Their 10H and MC are in Taurus, with its ruler Venus conjunct Pluto in the 11H.  Additionally, their Moon is in their 10H, just wide enough from the MC that I personally wouldn't consider it a conjunction but not too far off either. There's very much an intensity to their public image, between Pluto's presence, and the 10H and 11H aspects to their 8H Saturn, which makes me wonder if death was somehow involved in what they were most known for. It's possible that the concerns of their social circles and marriage were publicly known, too. As far as what they did for a career, I get poet first and foremost, I think in combining Gemini's penchant for communication with Taurus' aesthetic sensibilities, plus Venus and the Moon in there. With the Moon so close to the MC, I would expect the native's emotional life (or some version of it) to be part of their work or image, as well as possibly their body.
4. Themes - With so many of the native's planet in houses 10, 11, 12, and 1, I would surmise that the native's identity, social standing, and perception in the public eye were consistent themes in their life. Additionally, with so many planets in houses that are in aversion to the AC (12, 8, and 6), I would guess that a frustration between the tangibility of the ""public self"" (how easy it can be to know that version of oneself, as the one that we possibly create or have more control over) against the ""unknowability"" of the internal, ""true"" self was another theme. I get a general sense of ""I want to be perceived and liked as a kind of bohemian, floaty, everyman kind of person, have my cake and eat it too as far as relationships both romantic and otherwise. And yet, as a result of creating such a persona, I don't feel that I really know myself or am doing much of anything significant, which sometimes causes me stress and sometimes causes me to burst with energy to do something to try and assuage that.""
5. Death - This is an aspect of astrology I'm far more unfamiliar with, beyond death as a general signification of the 8H. With Pisces ruling, I might think that the native had sort of a romanticized concept of death, though with Saturn there, there might have also been a seriousness or attention towards the history of death or something. I have no clue how to read for length of life or anything like that (I've intentionally avoided that kind of knowledge, I don't think I want to be able to know that about myself or others) but, just with the above information, I'd think they lived to an old age (again, relative to the time period in which they were alive). Though their 6H placements (Uranus and Mars conjunct in Capricorn) might point to a sudden onset of a severe disease, maybe later in life."
1078v8m,j3qmmrv,UnhappyHyena799,2023-01-10 12:07:20,3,"This is amazing!  
  
I never used the whole house system. So my interpretations could be blatantly wrong, but I still want to give it a try regarding the life / profession / career of this person.  
  
I will first start with Saturn in Pisces, ruled by Jupiter and Neptune, both in the 12th house in Cancer, which is already a pretty hard hit.  
The 8th house, originally Scorpio, is in the 4th house, ruled by Pluto and Mars which are in the 11th and 6th house respectively. The 6th house in Capricorn is ruled by Saturn and the 11th house is Aquarius originally, ruled by Saturn aswell. This suggests alot of struggles and upheavals in early life, up around 20-30 y/o.  
  
The active 12th house is generally an indicator for any kind of addictions. Since it's in Cancer, ruled by the Moon, I'd guess that it's a drug/alcohol addiction or abuse of any substance (maybe at a pretty young age), maybe to deal with depression, or other kinds of mental disorders. However, we have to keep in mind that the 12th house can be a strong indicator for a profound spiritual awakening, when the native was able to deal with all of these struggles and preasure.  
  
With the 4th house connection I'd guess that the native had an extremely hard time in early life, in regards of family/parents. The early life could be based completely on fear, maybe due to a dragic loss or even abuse. This would be the crucial point for the possible addiction/drug abuse. As for later life, there's a high tendency for multiple relationships/marriages, or atleast struggles, to get any kind of pleasure impulses, which were nonexistant in childhood/early life, maybe due to missing love from (absent) parents.  
  
With the 6th house Capricorn and Mars + Uranus in there, I'd guess that there have been massive health issues, maybe a birth desease, such as the mental disorder, or the health issues came from the drugs, or the drug abuse was the consequence for it. The conjunct can be extremly dangerous, it can lead to an anarchist, resulting in unpredictable instability. Alot of risk for impulsive, unwise decisions.  
All the oppositions from Mars and Uranus to the 12th house make everything written above even more dramatic, especially if the mental issue and drug/addiction aspect is true. However, the Sun opposite can indicate someone who fought through all the hard times and challenges.  
  
With both Mars & Uranus being in the 6th house, which is Virgo, orignally ruled by Mercury, which is in the first house in Leo, my first idea would be that this person started to express all the pain and drama in some form of art, especially in books and/or started to speak about it openly.  
  
The Mercury trine Saturn underlines the possibility of a successful entrepreneur / sales person, or atleast someones whos good with words and expressing himself, so maybe the person started to market their books and began to speak to certain groups and communities.  
  
Since my main focus point was the moon, being in the 10th house, this person has always strived really deeply for a flourishing and fulfilling career.  
So I'm now pretty certain that the active 12th house in Cancer, ruled by the Moon, didn't lead on the wrong path, such as suicide, an overdose or being a killer, but to a spiritual awakening, initiated by all the pain and drama in earlier life.  
With the Moon in Taurus ruled by Venus in the 11th house, this led to the deeper purpose of sharing all the dramatic experiences with like minded people and the collective."
1078v8m,j3svhmm,ghosteegoo,2023-01-10 21:07:09,3,"First time trying one of these, I'm still learning so please go easy on me! 

  
**Personality - what was the native like? character, behavior, traits, habits, etc. what was their sense of self like?**

With the sun in Cancer in the 12th house in conjunction with Neptune and Jupiter, i think the native was a very emotional dreamer type, unrealistic expectations, reality really hitting them hard.  
The native valued love and friendships, they craved deep connections in general but never felt like they could achieve or keep them. had a “felt alone in a crowded room” complex possibly?  
Shaky on this one but the moon in Taurus in the 10th House squaring the AC in Leo and Conjunct the MC, they used humor as a defense mechanism or self deprecating humor, just didn’t want to bring people down so they covered it up/faked a smile.   
Kind and generous, fun to be around but deeply sad underneath it all

  
**Relationships - any romantic partners? How about children? Friends? What did those relationships look like?**

Chiron in the 7th house Trine Pluto and Venus in conjunction in the 11th house. I want to say they had a lot of relationships, or perhaps they were promiscuous, using sex as a coping mechanism with Saturn in the 8th house squaring Pluto and Venus.  
No children? (Not great in that area though..) Lots of friendships but most being toxic, ending badly or the native longs for friends but can’t seem to make connections or keep them

  
**Career - what did they do for a living? what are they known for? what aspects of their life influenced their work?**

with the moon conjunct the MC/10th house, being the ruling planet of the 12th house semi-sextile with Pluto and Venus in the 11th, squaring Chiron in the 7th  and in combination with the quintile aspect to mercury in the 1st makes me think they were very vocal about their trauma and mental illness, with mercury in Leo and the AC squaring the moon and in trine with Venus maybe they were a performer, like a musician? possibly a dancer or maybe motivational speaker. 

  
**Themes - what were some major patterns in the natives life? where/what did they spend a lot of their time/attention/energy on? general vibe/direction of the chart?**

The general vibe is a very emotional, damaged person, using art to express their pain maybe in the form of music or dancing, possibly struggling with promiscuity/sex addiction, lots of toxic relationships, a dreamer with unrealistic expectations. A strong person that either eventually succumb to suicide or had a sudden decline in their health resulting in early death

  
**Death - how did the native pass away? What was their relationship with death and dying?**

Very interesting with the 6th house Mars and Uranus conjunct in Capricorn, both in retrograde and Mars being Exalted in Capricorn, adding in the opposition to Neptune, Jupiter and the Sun in the 12th house, i could guess a sudden rapid decline in health resulting in early death, or sudden violent suicide due to the mental illness/depression. although the exalted Jupiter in the twelfth leads me to believe they were resilient in dealing with their struggles through their artistic expression."
1078v8m,j48cn2r,Ravensinger777,2023-01-13 21:36:11,3,"I'm on a somewhat limited time schedule here so I'll toss out a few quick lines.  My first observation is Pluto in Gemini.  We haven't seen that in quite some time and it narrows down the time windows.

Sun in Can/12, Moon Tau/10 (in loose conj. To MC) suggests to me someone whom we know by their their private, inner/emotional life.  Their public persona is unusually and inextricably linked to the way they process their interactions with their world.  Leo AC suggests to me that this is their act, their mask - emotions used as both  sword and shield to protect the real person within.  

The oppositions are there and I'll get there, but Pluto-Venus?  That super-tight conjunction between Pluto and Venus says to me that this is someone who loves intensely and with complete devotion - but Gemini/11 suggests that this could be a concept or an archetype as much as (or more than) an actual noun.  More in love with the idea of a woman than with an actual woman, for example, though that could be transferred if they found a person who they felt suitably carried that anima/animus for them. 

Supporting that, the Saturn square from Pisces/8 - another mutable sign pinned to the succedent house of its element.  The native is committed to that which they love... in their own way.  Pisces has its own understanding of what is ""moral"" and ""right.""  Wandering must be permitted.  Nobody can be the perfect expression of someone else's anima/animus for long.  I think that this person had a somewhat more flexible understanding of morality than what their society permitted, and their love life could be a real source of drama and trouble in that regard.  Even advancing the chart around to put the ASC on the 1st House cusp would not change this aspect of their character, so I think it can safely be described as fundamental to them. 

Saturn is sitting in Pluto's home house, also sextiles the 10th House Moon, which is in its sign of exaltation, and Taurus' ruler Venus is snuggled up with Pluto.  Dramatic indeed: I want to say that this is someone who had the capacity to sacrifice themselves for love.  Not in some nebulous cosmic sense, not in a religious sense, not as some misguided illusion - there is potential in this set of placements for true and passionate love to the point of insanity.  

Gemini's involvement could mean this was a serial attachment or a breakup-return pattern.  Whoever attracted this person's love interest was not going to let them go until this person said they could go (and the breakup could be pretty damn cold).  In any case, it played out very publicly.

This is separated from the solar aspects and I think that's important.  Sun in Cancer/12 would be a person with caring, nurturing qualities but one who also keeps their distance.  They're hard to know, they may not be well-liked, possibly quite lonely, but they know where all the bones are buried.  Leo Rising: their hair (or lack thereof) would have been an important part of their self-image.  Mercury in Leo/1is far enough away from the Sun to be in no danger of combust: intelligent and a person who is keenly aware of their public image.  Also possibly someone who found joy and purpose in creating intellectual work for public consumption.   If they were a writer they might well have been a firebrand type (Leo/1st are both fire-associated), but I think not a revolutionary (no Uranus involvement).  As a painter or photographer they may have been willing to break taboos around sex or death for the sake of art (that Saturn in Pisces trine Mercury).

Sun/Neptune conjunction suggests someone who is an artist, a dreamer, permanent rose-colored glasses.  The dark side of this is escapism and the 12th House placement reinforces: sex is one means of escape, substance abuse is another.  On the Sun's other side is Jupiter, aligned with Neptune through Pisces (and the associated 12th House).  And the North Node, so while we know them for the public drama, it's this inner journey of the real person that was their real destiny.  All of this is opposed to Mars and Uranus, both retrograde in Cap/6.  I'm inclined to say that this person didn't have a lot of self-discipline to counter the tendency to overindulge (Jupiter) in pleasure and escapes.  

Mars is exalted in Capricorn, which emphasizes the retrograde action in this case.  Uranus retrograde involvement makes me think self-sabotage.  Well and so.  I'm getting very much a masculine vibe off of this chart with so much Air and Fire, so I'm going to go ahead and posit a he, or a mascline-presenting individual for whom masculine pronouns could be accurately used.  If he couldn't obtain what he obsessed over (Pluto/Venus), he could quite easily drink or drug himself to death.

I am not seeing any indicatons of children (5th house is empty with a fire sign, traditionally considered barren, on the cusp).  Chiron is isolated, retrograde, in ""barren"" Aquarius: this doesn't support a permanent marriage, either, and I think the Saturn squared off against Pluto-Venus would never make a legal commitment as such. 

Chiron being both isolated and retrograde suggests a deep-seated pain that cannot be healed.  The intensity of this chart is one that does not suggest a long and easy life - I lean more towards carrying a torch that burned at both ends in a very public manner until burnout and early death."

Thank you so much for the incredibly detailed response! 

As a newbie myself, it’s super interesting to witness your reading! Very helpful. I think you did an amazing job and made some very fascinating connections that I probably would have missed! 

Generally, you did really good! Check again later this week to the specific answers, but i think you had most of it pretty close. I’ll give you a vague response so you can get a little feedback! 

-

The segment of “fairytale version of their identity” and having a complex inner experience is very on the nose! 

The bit about their career was nice! I think the association between the 8H was a nice detail to catch. Certainly their work focused on themes death / rebirth / trauma / sex (plutonian and 8H themes) and a huge focus on the body and personal emotions. So that was perfect. They were not a poet, but certainly an artist, so I think you were on the right track! 

I haven’t done all my research yet, so perhaps i dont have all the details for the relationships section, but i don’t think that most of the 1st half is quite right… they also never had any children (but good try on this, makes sense tbh). The end of this answer was the most accurate! Venus + Pluto square pisces saturn = love affairs! They did have one major partner, but it was quite bumpy and up and down! 

For themes I think you are okay. Perhaps there were certainly elements of this conflict between public vs private self, but maybe in a different way than how you set it up. The native spent a lot of time in isolation and probably had a lot of emotion regarding public outings which they didn’t get the chance for much! 

Romanticization of death is perhaps accurate (i can’t say for certain, but given the context that was likely an element.) as for length of life, the native actually had a relatively short life, not a long one. Severe disease is somewhat correct, but not quite… more like health complications. However these were not the direct cause(s) of death!

Overall you did great! Thanks so much for sharing!

To start, I’m impressed by your style of reading! The connections you made quite clear and effective! Not all of it was totally correct, but all of it was practical and translated well into possible real life examples. 

Also, (since you mentioned never having used whole signs) it was interesting to see you make a kind of blended technique!!! 

Whole Signs, being the oldest style of western astrology, is often read in the hellenistic style. In hellenic astrology, the ancients saw the houses and the signs as distinct. There is a modern system (developed mostly to simplify and make memorization easier) called the Alphabet system that assigns 1 sign to each house and states that the sign and the house share meanings. So the Alphabet System says that Virgo = 6H and 6H = Virgo. 

In my studying I’ve been looking at each house as separate from it’s “alphabet” ruling sign. 

So when I look at the ruler of a house, I’m looking strictly at the sign ruling the house in that specific chart… 

But you were looking at both the actual sign that ruled each house AND the alphabet rulers for each house! And it worked flawlessly! I’ve never seen that ahahaha! 

Especially the bit about “heavy 6H placements… mercury is alphabet ruler of 6H, and merc in the 1H leo… began to express all the pain via art!” That is spot on! Such a clear connection that I wouldn’t have seen using just hellenistic techniques! 

Just goes to show that astrology is an ever evolving practice ^ why limit yourself to one system vs another when you could have the best of both worlds! I will certainly be taking notes and try out looking at both actual house rulers and alphabet rulers! Excited to see how that works"
1078v8m,j3s6t66,Frogchairy,2023-01-10 18:38:51,2,"This person did struggle with opioid, alcohol, and cigarette addictions. This were used primarily as coping mechanisms for all the pain caused by their prominent health issues. Their life long health accidents/issues (starting at a young age) also forced the native into a lot of isolation. Not so sure about the details of childhood family life, but they certainly grew to have many love affairs and complicated up/down marriage. They did become hugely successful and renowned for their artistic expression. They did however, contrary to your comment, die of suspected suicide via overdose. The native died at the age of 47."

Oh babe you nailed it! Really great work :)   


Certainly someone who struggled with feeling alone. Very emotional and focused on surrealism! Reality certainly hit them like a truck... As far as more detailed personality, like you guessed at, there is not quite enough information to understand that with any certainty. But given the rest of your accuracy, that sounds about right! 

They certainly had a lot of relationships (with all kinds of people)! A long term marriage too, but it was quite on and off and more of a turbulent open relationship. 

You are right on the money for being vocal about their mental health and personal struggles. They were a recognized artist for such themes. Close on musician, but they were actually a painter! 

Your 'themes' answer is totally legit. 

As for death, you have got the gist of it. The native died at the age of 47 from suspected suicide via overdose. They suffered from severe mental health and physical health issues. Especially the physical health. Dramatic/violent accidents and disease in their youth really dominated their life and was clearly an obvious contributor to their pain both physically and emotionally/mentally/spritually."

Somehow I missed this comment, sorry I didn't reply sooner. 

Great work! You nailed a significant amount of the chart. Your style of reading is very deep and detailed! 

I can't claim accuracy on a lot of these statements because such personal information is not publicly available, but I'm sure if someone knew the individual that what you said would make perfect sense! 

\---

This person was certainly well known for their personal/emotional life and inner toil. They did express that via their art = a famous painter. 

They did not really front a revolution in art... but are famous for being the first painter from their country to be featured in the Lourve. 

They certainly dealt a lot of with fantasy/surrealism, so what describe in their love life makes sense. Especially the Gemini influence of ""on and off"" relationship. They had many romantic/sexual partners of all genders, but they had one life long spouse with whom they shared a dramatic and rocky relationship. 

Their relationship was indeed public. No children! I think probably due to infertility via health accidents. 

Certainly focused on a lot of taboo topics of sex, bodies, death, mental health, etc. 

They used drugs/alcohol as a means to escape their constant state of pain. They spent their entire life dealing with their chronic illnesses, both physically and mentally. 

They died at 47, several days after their birthday, from suspected suicide via overdose. 

This person was actually a woman. Although she played a lot with gender for her time. Had she been born in this era, I'm sure she would have pushed her gender even further and likely identified as non-binary or gender queer.

That's actually pretty funny. The first birthchart I've ever made for myself was Tropical with Placidus as default. However I didn't know anything about it back then. While I was reading interpretations of the placements, most didn't seem to fit, so I rejected it at first.

I then learned about the Sidereal from someone whom I've learned alot of other stuff from, and he showed how incredibly accurate it is. I did my chart and it really was mindblowing how almost every placement started to make sense for me. The most important thing in the Sidereal are the Nakshatras. Easily put, they are 27 ""smaller houses"", which are set for each zodiac sign, and they never change.

After working with it for some time, I somehow got put off a little bit. Maybe because I was getting more knowledgable and by doing so, I was spotting some possible errors.

So I went back to Tropical and Placidus and most of the placements started to make more and more sense, as I had more knowledge to analyze it properly.

However, after some time, similar to Sidereal, I was put off again. I don't know why, but I had the feeling that some things didn't add up.

I then learned from my original source that he'd use the Nakshatras and put them over the Tropical chart, which was kind of fascinating, because it was damn accurate. And it makes sense aswell, because as mentioned, the Nakshatras are fixed to each sign, whatever Housesystem you use. Surely their interpretations might have a vedic touch, but they're still incredibly fitting.

So I experimented further and learned about Interception. I realized that with Placidus, my 2nd and 8th house are intercepted and this just didn't make any sense at all.

Because of your post I had to look into Whole Houses. I'm a practical learner and follow my inner feeling in trying things out, but this was the first time I actually had to look into the origins and theory of it all. And now I know why it was important. I fell into the trap that Placidus is the default setting for almost every calculator and it seems like this is pretty dangerous. 

Now it makes alot of sense that it was Sidereal rather than Tropical/Placidus which resonated way wore in the beginning. Reason being, Sidereal uses the Whole House system! They simply use a different Ayanamsa by default, I believe 23° instead of °0.

The Sidereal with default settings is similar to the Tropical with Whole House system. Since the planets' placement in the houses only varies a few degrees, it's almost identical to the Tropical with Whole Houses. In my case, it's only Rahu, Pluto and Uranus that ""move down"" one House.

The main difference is that the signs between Sidereal and Tropical are going to be different and I believe that's what put me off regarding the Sidereal in the end. For example, in the Sidereal I'd be Libra Rising rather than Scorpio Rising and that couldn't be any further away from truth. (Eventhough I have my Sun, Venus, Mercury, Rahu & Chiron in Libra in the Tropical 😂)

However, since all systems have their place and say, in one way or another, you'd still come to similar conclusions, eventhough the charts might be different. 

Besides all the practical trial & error, I now realize that I still have to lay a proper foundation, so I'm currently diving into great resources that were shared in this sub recently.

It might have been a little bit too early for me to forge two, or even three different systems, and parts of certain systems together, and eventhough it seems to be extremely accurate, it works until it doesn't. 😉

Just for reference, most of the connections I was able to make, because I'd look at the most important Nakshatra in the natives chart first and then see, which of the other placements and aspects would support it. 🙂

But it love it, this was my Impulse to finally dive deeper into TRUE astrology, also thanks to your post!"

1078v8m,j3veeay,Frogchairy,2023-01-11 09:12:25,3,"Aw yay!!! 

This response makes me so happy!

I'm still learning too, so it's really helpful to hear you talk about your process and learning experience! Pretty early on in my experience I had a friend who encouraged me to check out Whole Signs. And so I really began my astrology education with the \*controversial\* placidus vs. whole sign ""debate."" 

And I totally agree with what you mentioned. Most people have a tendency to be stubborn and resist change once they are set in their ways. People develope their preferences based on what they first encounter, and not on ""data"" so to speak. 

not a lot of folks are choosing a house system (if you even have to choose one at all) based on the evidence or pros/cons of the technique, but simply through circumstance. And having Placidus be the modern standard for western charts has created an explosion of placidus users. And because everyone on the internet thinks they are the most qualified person in the planet to speak on any topic they want, I see people trying to one up each other on astrology styles all the time... pop astrology just has everything so convoluted and misinformed lol 

I think a lot of folks would benefit from THEORY. Not just what certain palcements mean, but looking at and studying WHY those placements mean those things. Astrology is infinitely complex, with so many elements. So much so that it can be overwhelming and it can feel like there are so many things to memorize and they work as they do ""just because"" thats how it is! But then people only get a superficial and limited understanding. 

Doing critical research into the reasons and history behind the practice is so important to see the modern associations and meanings to today and to understand them with real confidence and fluency!  I'm always trying to push people to try exploring other house systems and to study hellenic astrology because it is the blueprint for modern western astrology! So many things that are never explained in pop astro have actual very detailed origins and reasonings in hellenic theory! 

A lot of people these days enjoy sorting themselves into boxes i think... I would much prefer to be creative and exist beyond such boxes! Be non-binary in approach to astrology ( and the world at large)! I think it's important to recognize that there is no singular ""correct/incorrect"" way to do anything! Each of us have the power to do things the way that work best for us! Imagine how fun astrology could be if everyone truly trusted themselves and shared their own personal reading styles. It is an ever evolving practice, and we are an increasingly diverse generation of humans, so I think it only fitting that astrology follow suit :) 

it is so cool that you started your journey hopping around between different styles and techniques. This has obviously made you a really excellent reader!

I haven't explored vedic at all, but you have certainly inspired me to take the plunge! The Nakshatra sound really interesting and insightful! I always appreciate techniques that help to asses/evaluate the weight/importance of placements and their impact on the chart. 

I'm glad you have been inspired too ahaha! I love this reciprocal exchange happening! If you ever want to discuss, I would be happy to be astro buddies! I could send you lots of good resources for whole signs and hellenic astro theory! And I would totally appreciate some vedic pointers ahaha

Wild guesses -

I think the native might have had some type of dream career or career goal that they pursued - they didn't ""fall into"" their employment but got there deliberately. I could see them as an educator, journalist, researcher, musician, international trader, or someone in a leadership role but I'm pulled towards wondering whether they ever worked with children, and, perhaps they were a nurse, doctor or physician. I wouldn't be surprised if they possessed a lot of expertise in their field.

In terms of personality, the choleric and phlegmatic tempers seem mixed together in a balanced way to my eyes. So I'm guessing the person was emotionally aware and able to be still if needed, but also knew how to use that emotional tendency to push forward with their goals and to take on a sense of urgency.

The marriage was maybe to someone with business acumen or a head for numbers. I think their children were very important to them but perhaps not always easy to raise.

I'm not sure how the native passed away but perhaps their death was very prominent and known about with the ruler of the 8th house at the Mc."

Good luck very active in passion projects and lots of kids early in life. Married but divorced. Valued home and family. A natural teacher. Center of attention but caused them a lot of trouble. No like groups but dissolved into them anyway. 

For death I wrote died suddenly/violently defending home, died in war, or domestic feud. Which wasn’t correct except for the home and the suddenly and maybe the war bit if you count fighting terminal illness a war."

zqiu28,j2r3cbe,Curious-Can4908,2023-01-03 10:13:27,3,"Hi 👋 the results are posted above. Great job with your guess. Also just want to say, I see the 22 degree a lot in personal charts. It's quite common in many people who do not commit suicide or get murdered. So to those reading, do not panic. It is a saturn ruled degree, so its a degree with tough lessons and hard work and may manifest worse in a night chart imo. If you do panic, you can used the advanced search on astroseek to find celebrity charts with placements at 22 degrees. Many die of natural causes."

1) definitely pursued deliberately and did get their dream career. Not quite getting the career correct though. Maybe look to mercury conjunct MC in leo and try again. 2) I'd say accurate 3) accurate on the children. Not really accurate with the description of spouse(s) as far as I know lol. One was the nanny 😆 4) definitely accurate with prominent well know death. You could try to elaborate if you want. There's no shame in trying and taking a gamble."

zqiu28,j2vhlzd,Curious-Can4908,2023-01-04 05:41:09,2,"12th house rules mental anguish and self undoing. Basic 12th house significations there. If you follow traditional astrology, 12th house is quite a negative house. Other key words for 12th house are asylums, prisons, hospitals, isolation, spiritual realm, retreat, rest, dreams, ghosts, hidden enemies, hidden things in general, large animals, foreign places, sorrow, grief, endings. Pluto rules psychology. Heavy pluto brings out what's hidden in your subconscious and can manifest your greatest fears. Heavy pluto people will usually struggle with mental health and their own psychology. The answer to a Heavy pluto transit will always be therapy. Pluto also rules transformation. So, heavy pluto people have things ripped away from them constantly so they can start over in a rebirth phase. It's exhausting and trying for mental health. Pluto also rules manipulation and power and worst case, abuse. Also trying for mental health. Some other pluto significations are decay, the underworld, destruction, obsession, major disasters, earthquakes and volcanoes, clairvoyance, occultism, kundalini, spiritual awakening, healing. It's a dark energy, a baptism by fire. 

Mercury (mind) conjunct pluto is a mind that can easily turn on itself. It's having to constantly transform the way you think and communicate. It's a mind that can get obsessive about things. It needs depth and to get to the root of things. It's a mind that mistrusts everything and everyone. It may know how to manipulate people with their words. It can provoke deep intimacy with people but then doubt the intimacy or want to go deeper. A deep that doesn't even exist on a material plane. It's wanting badly to merge minds with another person and simultaneously terrified of that and sabotaging it. It's wanting to be so connected to another's persons mind that you don't need words to communicate at all. Its telekinetic. It's knowing the truth all the times and that being a blessing and a curse. Its a mind that is either in the underworld or in springtime and no in between. This placement can be so healing for other people but the native will probably struggle at times regardless. 

Mercury conjunct pluto conjunct the MC in Leo is like...wanting to be the best entertainer there ever was to influence the masses. Wanting to be the sunshine for others so they can't feel the darkness because you KNOW the darkness. It's trauma that makes you need all the outside validation because you can't find that in yourself. It's needing to be in the spotlight and being obsessive about your career because thats the only way you feel worthwhile. It's feeling your best when you're center of attention but always knowing when you're alone your mind may turn on you. It's having your shadows be in the spotlight regardless of how charming, entertaining, and generous you are. So you can see its a tough placement, and likely some of these themes are what drove Williams to fame and drugs/alcohol and ultimately suicide, in combination with some of the other aspects and influences I mentioned. 

Hope that helps. If you want to delve deeper into basic significations, the astrology podcast is an excellent resource and they do in depth significations of all the planets, houses, signs, etc. The one on pluto is wonderful. The Twelve Houses by Howard Sasportas is where I started with learning the houses."

But we've had several times where no one wants to or they get busy or something, so a couple of us have jumped in with charts to keep it going. The winner of this one said they would post, but I just checked and they haven't. Let me check in with them, and I'll let you know if they if they still plan to. In general, if you see one hasn't been posted in a couple weeks or longer, it's probably ok to just post one lol. But you can always check with the mod. 

We've been just doing birth charts, but I think it would be cool to expand sometimes and do some death charts, transit charts, synastry, etc. Let me touch base with the mod though. I dont want to overstep. I'll get back to you."

zqiu28,j1tussg,rectovrso,2022-12-27 10:03:36,4,"The only pointer I got about native’s death for this particular chart is the 22 degree. 

I was just assuming with that degree in MC, native’s death could possibly be something of a public news, in Leo as well. Additional element is Pluto so close to MC. Sometimes Pluto can represent tragedy.

Aside from that, 8H can sometimes represent death as well and I see Uranus there. It can also mean something that came as a shock. Mars in 8H provide the same effect. I’m taking wild guess here but the placement of these planets in Cancer, I would say happened in a place native called home."

Sure! I haven’t led one of these before, but it would be fun to try :) 

Is there a little set of instructions somewhere so I can ensure I got all the correct elements for the post? 

Thanks 💕"
zqiu28,j1zqnjm,Frogchairy,2022-12-28 16:45:34,6,"The Astrology Podcast with Chris Brennan has an episode titled “The Master of the Nativity: Finding the Ruler of the Chart” in which ancient ‘Length of Life’ techniques are used to predict how long someone will live! 

It’s super complicated, but a simplified version is to look at the ruler of the AC. You can also look at the bound lord. 

12° Scorpio is ruled by the bound lord Mercury. 
The domicile ruler of Scorpio is Mars. 

Each planet is associated with a number of years predicting length of life. 

Mercury is given 76 years, and Mars is given 66 years. So I would guess between those ages?! 

Do you know how old this actor was when they died? They have a very prominent Mars, so I’m leaning closer to the lower end of that age range. 

I haven’t really used this technique before tho ahaha, so we shall see if its any good"

Thanks for replying!

I'm not any good at astrology so it's why I don't speculate much and try to keep to simple guesses, but ty for encouraging me. A Mercury in Leo career... work for the government? Accounting? Lawyer or judge? Speech writer, or other kind of writer? A presenter, or television worker? Singer? Jupiter rules the 5th and trines Mercury - an artist, someone who makes something with their hands?

Lol on the spouse, that is interesting. 

I'm not sure what type of death Mercury could bring. Since it is in Leo, something to do with the heart maybe? Mercury digests - some type of substance?"

I think in personal astro, the 22 degree just represent more restriction or creating a more Saturnian effect to whatever planet its on. Since 22 represent Capricorn."

10jcw36,j5lyhgl,theHBIC,2023-01-23 23:05:28,5,I think it’s important to sit down with your supervisor and decide what your role is. How will they determine your caseload? What will you work on versus them? What do you need to do to pass practicum? All of those questions will help guide your work.
10jcw36,j5nizc0,Amarmuss,2023-01-24 06:41:42,2,Ask a million questions about everything and get copies of anything cool your supervisor does or has created. Make sure you learn how the non-counseling tasks work too; realistically you will have to do some sort of regular meetings or paperwork so learn it while you have someone to teach it to you—especially if you want to stay in the same district/ state. It will make year 1 way smoother. Introduce yourself to absolutely all staff members you encounter. This feels awkward but they are always wondering who you are and it is great practice for building rapport in the school.

10jcw36,j5mber6,theHBIC,2023-01-24 00:36:06,5,"The original commenter does have a point, albeit not worded the best. Your practicum and internship really are semester-long job interviews; many counselors from my cohort were hired by districts straight out of internship, and many of us (myself included) got a provisional job so we were working as a counselor while doing internship. Communicate with your supervisor often; ask questions all the time. Be curious and take mental notes. You don’t have to do things exactly the way your mentor does, and you can learn from anyone."
10jcw36,j5lyzu2,Psynautical,2023-01-23 23:08:56,3,That's how I was interviewed by the head of the district I interned in before my internship ended in the middle of the great recession. And how I've never not had multiple offers.

10ct481,j4i9ssv,IndependentSet5750,2023-01-15 22:32:19,3,"Practicum I completed one day a week at the school I was assigned for a semester. Internship was 3 full days a  week for a whole school year. I nannied on the days I wasn’t at my internship since my classes were all late afternoon/evenings. My program required we had our hours a certain way so I didn’t have much flexibility other than choosing which days I went into school. 

I totally understand your need to work! It’s definitely possible. What is the current position you were offered part-time?"
10ct481,j4iqm93,erliz97,2023-01-16 00:25:57,2,"For practicum, I was at my site one day a week. For internship, I was at my site 3-4 days a week. I was able to choose the days I came in but I definitely tried to come in during days that I knew would be busy (i.e. Mondays tended to be a busy/catch up day for my supervisors). I nannied on the days I wasn’t at my site but I would also recommend subbing. Subbing helps you get a glimpse of different grade levels and you can also meet a ton of school professionals. I also feel that getting experience in the classroom is a must for becoming a school counselor. I’ve been subbing while I’ve been interviewing and waiting to hear back from jobs and I honestly wish I subbed instead of nannied but both are still great options!"
10ct481,j4jm6rg,WednesdayRogers,2023-01-16 04:15:44,2,"I worked part-time and did multiple levels. I did a ton of work from home for my internship and prioritized direct hours only when on site. I worked approx. 20 hours on top of 40 hours of internship. 

I’d do most of my indirect hours on weekends as my day job was also Mon-Fri. My internship supervisor was awesome about encouraging me to log absolutely everything and after half my time at an elementary I did a quarter at a HS and the rest at a middle. 

Good luck! Internship was my absolute favorite. I had some amazing supervisors."

10ct481,j4i74fj,root-bound,2023-01-15 22:15:09,4,"I was on the quarter system, so I think total for both practicum & internship was about 3 quarters. My internship hours I remember lasted Sept-Feb."
10ct481,j4ior8f,IndependentSet5750,2023-01-16 00:12:58,2,I would definitely try to continue working that position. It will be great for your resume when applying to counseling gigs.
10ct481,j4iow1k,BOCpesto,2023-01-16 00:13:55,1,I so appreciate the advice!
10i34oo,j5ce5so,GeneralChemistry1467,2023-01-21 23:53:56,15,"Nearly every practicum student has expressed everything you say here verbatim. What you're feeling is normal, and it'll be fine. My advice to new pilots is always this: Don't freak out about not knowing what to say or saying the wrong thing - just *be real*. If the client feels authentically seen and cared about, nothing you say or fail to say will wreck the session or damage rapport. I've seen beeb Ts mess it up because they were trying so hard to follow The Therapist Script, or track how many head nods they were doing, that the client didn't perceive empathy.

I know that *relax* is hard advice to take in this situation, but it'll serve you well. To a certain extent grad school de-naturalizes a natural process; making a genuine human connection is something we already do effortlessly in our lived lives, most of us don't have to think consciously about 'how' to do it. That pedagogical de-naturalizing is for good reason (teaches you intentionality etc) but it also means that a lot of new clinicians start their client work petrified about not knowing how to do a thing they actually already knew how to do before they even started their program. Yes, therapy dialogue is a unique type of conversation, and has different parameters than everyday conversations, but all that rests on the base of the same human connectioning you've done a million times. You'll do great!"
10i34oo,j5d40q5,Jazzlike-Pollution55,2023-01-22 03:02:09,11,"No one ever knows what they're doing. We're just people talking to people some of the best things people have told me and I've learned going into the field:

The client got themselves here up until this point, trust that they will continue to take care of themselves. 

It doesnt matter what treatment modality, or specialized training you have, the therapeutic relationship is the best predictor of success. What that means, is the human to human interaction is more important than any specific skills you have. Every one else can eat rocks,  no matter what they tell you, yes experience is good but being yourself as the therapist is far better than anything else. 

Carl Rogers didn't have an agenda. He literally just came in and listened to people. That's it. No fancy treatment modality, no cbt, or specific anything. He just believed in the person's ability to heal themselves. And he's basically the precurser to the right way to do therapy, client centered. That's all you need to do, just listen. 
 
Clients will stop coming in, and it happens. They might never tell you why, and that's just it. 

It's okay if you take it home. You're human, people's shit is gonna get to you. Just let yourself feel through it for a short amount of time, and then go back to doing things for you. 

We all teach the lessons we need to learn the most."
10i34oo,j5d17ie,ComprehensiveOwl9727,2023-01-22 02:40:44,5,"To put it bluntly, most of us had no idea of what we were doing the first time we were in a session and most of us still have moments where we have no idea what we are doing!

I agree with what another comment said, this is more than anything about human connection. Be yourself, authentic, curious, empathetic, and the rest will come with time and practice. 

You’ve got this!"
10i34oo,j5cwdno,carlrogersglasses,2023-01-22 02:05:20,5,"I’m an internship student so I am in the same boat as you. I just had a 1st session with a client a few days ago. My supervisor’s advice was just to build rapport with the client during the first few sessions. Get to know them, explain confidentiality & the therapy process, let them vent, that kind of thing. Good luck to you- I’m sure you’ll do great!"
10i34oo,j5d40w3,lil8mochi,2023-01-22 03:02:11,5,Just do person centered. Repeat what they say. Active listening. If they share something intense just say thank you for sharing that with me.
10i34oo,j5djzlr,lagertha9921,2023-01-22 05:19:26,3,"I was terrified I was going to screw someone up in my Practicum. 

My Practicum professor, Tiffany Brooks, simply said to us “It never hurts anyone to just listen”. I try to remember that and sit with that whenever I feel some Imposter Syndrome creeping in."
10i34oo,j5d4n7c,whisperspit,2023-01-22 03:07:07,2,Do you have your own therapist?
10i34oo,j5e1o86,Fun-Owl3437,2023-01-22 08:49:50,2,"Hey everyone! Thank you so much for all the wonderful advice, it means a lot! I'm still extremely nervous but I know that's natural. I have anxiety disorders and OCD myself so it can be hard to manage. I'm still going to go in and try my best even if I'm scared. I'm not gonna let anxiety get in the way of my dreams. Thank you all so much and I'll update you soon xx"
10i34oo,j5kx55s,Lu164ever,2023-01-23 19:08:23,2,"I’m in my second semester and saw 3 clients last week as part of my practicum. I posted here about my anxiety as well and received lots of helpful answers and it was all true, particularly for the first appointment, that at the end of the day it’s really just about listening, validating and connecting to your client. Practice some of the mindfulness/anxiety tools on yourself that you would encourage your clients to use. I used some “what’s the worst that could happen,” thinking to challenge my thinking. Maybe the client decides they’re looking for something different and doesn’t reschedule….Oh well! Or there are some awkward moments…oh well! You are not going to harm your client if you stick to the basics, so at the end of the day this isn’t the biggest deal in the world. And you might actually connect very naturally and enjoy your sessions! Everyone starts somewhere, including us, and your clients obviously know you’re a student. My last client of the week actually said to me “full disclosure, I saw one other therapist last week to kind of test out who I wanted to work with. I’m going to choose you because even though the other therapist has years of experience I thought it was weird that they talked for the majority of the time instead of me talking, and I feel more of a connection to you.” 🤯 
Give yourself space to not be great at something right from the start so that you can work towards becoming great at it."
10i34oo,j5d321p,WhoMew,2023-01-22 02:54:42,1,"I'm a recent graduate and just got my first job in CMH... and I still feel this way! I did my first 2 intakes last week and felt very incompetent,  fumbling over words, and forgetting questions. This week, I start taking clients and am still wondering what the heck I'm doing. Wishing I had had more practice as an intern but also feeling like I'd still be just as nervous."
10i34oo,j5h45qq,hmb28,2023-01-22 23:33:02,1,"I'm in the same boat! Not this week, but next week I'll be seeing my first client (as much as I'd like to put it off another week, I need to start getting direct hours!)

I hope my anxiety doesn't get in the way of rapport building.

I wish you luck, and I'm interested to hear how it goes!!"
10i34oo,j5i0m0f,Structure-Electronic,2023-01-23 03:20:46,1,You are going to be great. You got this!!
10i34oo,j5kuaco,kierkegaardenia,2023-01-23 18:50:42,1,"As someone who also has anxiety and tends to get in my head, one of my favorite pieces of advice is ""be boring and curious"". Somehow reminding myself to ""be boring"" actually just makes me come off as relaxed and thoughtful instead of hyperactive and nervous. Much easier to get in the groove and be authentic/present!"
10i34oo,j8je1ah,hmb28,2023-02-14 19:13:33,2,I see my first client tomorrow and I found your message very soothing. Thank you.
112ot55,j8m4uzf,Medieval-Mind,2023-02-15 09:07:40,3,"Depends on the country, I would think. However, from the perspective of someone who has done both, I would suggest that you, as the teacher, should take the practicum, rather than limit yourself to a certification, especially if you've never taught in any way before. Even a few hours of in-class time can do wonders for confidence (not to mention seeing what's like)."
112ot55,j8moj2q,midnight_reborn,2023-02-15 13:09:40,1,"Ok I appreciate the input and explanation :) It's an extra $1K for the practicum where I'm from, so I'll need to give it some more thought and hopefully more people chime in with their experiences."
112ot55,j8mp6lq,B007833,2023-02-15 13:15:30,1,A lot of decent employers now require in class practice for TEFL. My school no longer accepts online tefl or a tefl without teaching practice because it sets a standard and also shows which people are here to teach and which are here to travel or make 'easy money' with minimal effort.
112ot55,j8mvwwe,midnight_reborn,2023-02-15 14:11:14,1,Ahhh I see :)
10pbyhe,j6k4bdi,irbinator,2023-01-30 22:07:12,1,"Yeah, the practicum course will have you identify a gap in the information security / policy / cyber-physical systems space and develop a solution to address this gap. You will be paired in groups and every couple of weeks you will post a progress report and record a video presenting your progress. You will review and provide feedback for your peers. Near the end, you will have a final presentation no more than 15 minutes in length and will submit a final report.

As far as I know, no one has done any research under a professor but I wouldn’t discount it as a possibility. Try reaching out to Dr. Mustaque Ahamad or Dr. Brendan Kuerbis via email and see if that’s a possibility"

10pbyhe,j6nxvg4,stieland,2023-01-31 17:52:40,1,"Your Practicum can be your research project.  You need to define what problem you are trying to solve and then conduct the research.  You need to somehow wrap it around Cybersecurity - can be info systems related, risk, privacy, or policy related."
10w40wq,j7kvzzz,Immediate_Coconut_30,2023-02-07 15:21:04,4,"Congrats, you are going to learn so much! A few things off the top of my head, as someone who did a practicum on L&D: Bring a notebook along to jot things down in (to remember questions to ask your preceptor later, or things to look up, or things you learned that were new that you want to review later). Volunteer to do anything that is within your scope as a student -- but KNOW what you are/aren't allowed to do and don't get pressured outside of that scope. Some examples of things that you might be able to do as a student (again, make sure it's ok with your program/hospital) -- Prime any IV lines that needed to be hung, hang/start LR, check blood sugars, get the baby back on the monitor, do NB vital signs, administer NB meds, foley catheter, help prep for c-sections, help position laboring person, draw labs, start IVs, check cervical dilation behind nurse, help coach the birthing person/support people, make sure the baby warmer is set up and ready before delivery, help set up delivery tray, help assist to bathroom after delivery. If your nurse doesn't have much going on (long induction, e.g.), ask other nurses if you can watch if they have something interesting or unusual happening with their patients. Also I'm speaking just from experience on a solely L&D unit, but if you're in a LDRP unit, there will be even more things you can do as a student postpartum, too! 

One last thing that I would highly suggest if you get a chance during any downtime is to get super familiar with reading the EFM strips. You almost certainly won't be charting them as a student, since it requires training and certification. But what my preceptor had me do was review them in certain time segments (like 15 min, 30 min, whatever we were looking at that time) and write down what I thought I would chart on a piece of paper, and she'd review it with me and compare it to what she actually charted for that same segment. I learned a ton that way!"
10w40wq,j7ltyng,racrenlew,2023-02-07 19:03:17,3,"See as many things as you can- ask if you can watch if you overhear that a fetal scalp electrode (FSE) will be placed, or an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC,) or if there is a scheduled version (turning a malpresenting baby, ie breech, to vertex by external manipulation.) Ask all the questions- we love them! See if they will allow you to learn how to set up a delivery table- good practice for donning sterile gloves and maintaining a sterile field. *Be your nurse's shadow; follow them everywhere except the bathroom* 😂"
10w40wq,j7nwi55,Sarmouse-2005,2023-02-08 03:41:55,1,I’m interested in L&D and I’m only first semester but I have a question. How many patients does the nurse in L&D manage at one time?
10w40wq,j7o556r,Cutie7999999999,2023-02-08 04:56:06,2,"I just got hired as a new grad on L/D, and my unit normally manages 1 laboring patient at a time. We’re staffed really well, but if we’re short, which is rare, we may take 1 more, but it’ll be a patient who isn’t too far along with their labor"
10w40wq,j7p1lz8,racrenlew,2023-02-08 11:46:41,2,"Some facilities try to keep labor pts 1:1, like the place I'm traveling at now. But at my home hospital, we do 1:2 for labor pts; in that case, they try to keep you from having 2 complicated pts, ie someone on MgSO4, or a pt with crazy blood sugars/requiring FSBS q2hrs, etc."

- to be more adept in recognising the learning that is occurring (fine/gross motor skills, schemas etc.)

10cs3zh,j4hi4ex,OTPanda,2023-01-15 19:40:15,15,If you’re looking for autism centered resources my favorite is called the play project - this type of play therapy is maybe for a different purpose (skill building rather than mental health care but I do think there’s potential for some overlap!) I think making space for special interests and sensory needs is key- sometimes joining in for sensory play or with a repetitive behavior is a great way to validate it and build rapport. There are all kinds of therapies which do not validate these (I’m looking at you ABA) and even sometimes parents have a harder time accepting kids as they are so it seems simple but definitely start there!
10cs3zh,j4ihhs6,infinite_unlimited,2023-01-15 23:23:23,11,"As someone with Autism, who has also done play therapy as a counselor for kids with autism, familiarize yourself with different forms of communication. Play therapy is great for this because non verbals can be big indicators. 

Be aware of each child’s sensory needs and do your best to work with them. Neurodivergent or not, sometimes play therapy feels silly/pointless. It’s not. If it starts feeling like that, talk to your supervisor, find trainings, and try doing play therapy just on your own to get used to that feeing. You’ve got this!"

Do not go in trying to make autistic children act neurotypical. For example don’t discourage stimming as long as it’s not harmful. Don’t assume incompetence, do a thorough assessment because autistic people have strengths and deficits all over the board.

Focus on going with the grain of their enthusiasms and feelings, rather than against the grain by redirecting or any of the abusive ABA  stuff.

Give them as much control over their sensory environment as you can. Do your best to avoid any buzzing electric lights or other persistent electrical noises. If you can, get out into somewhere peaceful in nature. Be a student of their world, not a teacher of yours."

OP, practice respectful curiosity with your clients. You will have a lot of pressures to “fix” and change your clients. Those are bad expectations for neurotypical clients as well. 

People who are Autistic are People, full stop. Take just as much time learning who they are and what they care about, and more so with young people.

Play therapy can be an incredible avenue to explore this realm because it can be led by the client. I also recommend surfing lived experience resources such as “Embrace Autism” and “The Autistic Self Advocacy Network” to learn more about the beauty of neurodiversity. ASAN also has free resources including a short “Info for Parents” book that is immensely helpful. 

Another tool I recommend is Sonny Jane Wises’ (thelivedexperiencecounsellor on IG) DBT Skills Workbook for Neurodiverse People as another tool for your own learning as well as your practice.

To return to the pressure to alter who a client is from external forces: it is absolutely possible to work within oppressive environments and within oppressive frameworks in ways that honor your practice and your client’s agency. Notice the tension points your encounter, and document them for yourself so you can steer your ongoing education and have a clearer vision to bring to your supervision."

I have not had issues with sleep, but I am about to start practicum any day now. I am constantly ruminating and totally anxious about everything.

I, too have had things my supervisor promised to me in my interview be totally switched and told differently during my orientation.

I'm having this too. You're not alone.

Because of Jupiter and Neptune conjunct in the 10th I wonder about altered states/ spirituality and career; someone like Terrence Mckenna comes to mind, but the Pluto placement wouldn't be on for that. The Jupiter/ Neptune/ 10th at 0 degree Sag is interesting and makes me wonder if we're looking at some kind of cult spiritual person, like a Teal Swan or some kind of influencer such as her."

The fact that there’s also a lot of Virgo in the 8th shows me that they could also deal with a lot of darkness, secrets and the taboo. The virgo placements makes them super observant, detail oriented and practical. Their mars in the 1st in Aquarius tells me that they’re likely community/humanitarian focused but also unique, if they’re famous with lots of money they likely do a bunch of charity work, and they fight for the underdog. The moon in Leo/7th house shows me that they’re likely very generous, confident and probably enjoy being in the limelight. They’re probably also super intelligent and great with their communication skills being a grand air trine, not to mention mercury being in Virgo adds to that, except for the squares to mercury which adds some challenges. Neptune conjunct Jupiter shows me that they’re probably a spiritual type of person. Jupiter in Sagittarius in the 11th makes me think they’re likely very philosophical or enjoy travelling and learning new things. Since it’s square mercury, they probably have a lot going on in their heads and can have difficulty communicating those ideas/philosophies. Mercury is also square Saturn, adding some more difficulty with communication, but more so difficulty with structure, routine and boundaries. There’s also some tension between Jupiter and Saturn being at an opposition. They’re enthusiastic and also very cautious. Finding a balance between the two has likely been a challenge for this person. Wanting to go out in the world and explore with freedom vs having a routine and structure. Saturn in the 5th suggests that they need to work harder when it comes to children and creative expression. They could have trouble connecting with their inner child. For some reason I want to say this is Mila Kunis as she was the first person to pop into my head. Haha"
zfjo34,izjqrbj,rectovrso,2022-12-09 16:50:18,2,"
omg am nervous but gonna give it a shot. 

Neptune 10H, i’d say dabbling in performance art or something alike. Scorpio neptune close to MC, alluring and magnetic. 

10H ruler in 8 along with scorpio MC makes me think native has desire for power. Personal planets in 8H indicates a private person in general or smth about them is mysterious to public, like there’s always an added layer of mysteries. 

8H planets also made me think that this person came to “fruition” when they met their partner. A lot of things points to tech but I read that this is not someone in tech so I’d say that internet somehow is a big part that shape native life somehow. 

Leo moon, Mars 1H - native is unapologetically themselves. Taurus IC, grew up in stability. 

Been interested in degree theory lately and it’s very interesting to me that most of native’s degree is either 12 or 0. Exception for some. 

12 degree very pisces neptunian energy so taking a shot in the dark, does native struggle with drugs? Or health? Mercury 8H can indicate anxiety too, especially in virgo who demands perfection. Gemini saturn also might reflects depression/anxiety. In 5H might even feel like unable to articulate the creativity inside. Chiron 3H support the notion of struggle to communicate or expressing themselves. 

Moon in 22 degree, might indicate separation. But jupiter in 11H, indicate that native will find good luck in their wider connection.

Not knowing time of birth i dont know if this is day or night chart so unable to determine how the lumanaries and benefics and malific operate. But at quick reference by looking at where Pluto, Neptune and Uranus are you can deduct year of birth 1968-1970. Having Aquarius as AC this person is very unique and dresses very different than the collective. With Mars in Aquarius they are very motivated and seen as strong. 2H Pisces and Neptune in Sag they may make money from friends or networks but are secretive. They are very secretive of what they really do to make money. Sun and Venus conjunct in Virgo in 8H they love power and control. They have a huge ego and think their smarter than others. Having Mercury in Virgo does make them smart. Having Pluto at 29 degrees (anoretic degree) in Virgo and conjunct Venus (making Sun, Venus, Pluto a stellium) makes this a clusterf#ck so they probably have alot of psychological issues. They are very susceptible to lured into cults. They also love other peoples money and may have even swindled people out of money. Uranus in 9H of Libra makes them having difficulties with belief system, morals, ethics; they may weigh the scales of pros and cons so much they cant make decisions in this area. With Jupiter in Sag in 10H they have been able to expand their friends, social networks, etc but at 0 degrees they may overcompensate by expanding to much. Is this the lady that screwed people out of money by saying she had some medical test but didnt; I think she was just found guilty. Sorry cant remember her name."

You can even copy mine for the format- that's what I did from the week 6 practicum. Feel free to change up what questions you're asking people to answer too (although they are typically more general, like the ones above or ""What is the native's love life like?"" or ""What is their relationship with their parents like?"" etc)."

The native can absolutely be described as motivated and strong, possibly also unique although I don't think people would think of them as an especially different dresser (she's not like Lady Gaga, for example). They very well may be secretive about the way she makes money, but that's at least not what she's known for. From having read the native's autobiography, I think she would agree that she does have a sort of big ego!"

I couldn't sleep that night so out of fun just laid in bed and looked at the chart and said what popped out in my head of what I was seeing. I didn't really spend alot of time on it just trying to wear my mind out to go to sleep. LOL. Thank you I did enjoy that!

109hkeh,j3ybfs0,eltonjohnpeloton,2023-01-11 22:14:34,5,"The answer to that will vary a lot as it will depend on the schools policies and the hospital policies for that specific vaccine. 

Can you get titers done to show immunity instead of being fully vaccinated again?"
109hkeh,j3yiji0,fi-rex,2023-01-11 22:59:51,3,"Like someone said above, you can get your titers done to show you still have antibodies to polio. I’m an older student, didn’t have my vax records, and my doc just did a blood draw and ran them. It’s easy!"
109hkeh,j3yblsc,jinxxybinxx,2023-01-11 22:15:37,1,"Not me personally, but a friend of mine was able to participate solely because she had documentation of her next dose date. So they knew she was, in fact, getting the vaccine."
109hkeh,j40ac5x,ehcertnas,2023-01-12 07:30:40,1,I literally had to switch primary care doctors for my nursing program because my doctor wasn’t understanding I needed titers and kept requesting my records. Call ask ask specifically for the titers
109hkeh,j3yci0g,bluereocheese,2023-01-11 22:21:10,1,yes for some but the polio vaccine i need to get it done all over again….. because i don’t have a record
109hkeh,j3ycjsj,bluereocheese,2023-01-11 22:21:28,1,that was for the polio vaccine?
109hkeh,j3yg9p5,BenzieBox,2023-01-11 22:45:01,7,You can still get titers drawn to show immunity to things. I never got the chicken pox vaccine but had chicken pox as a kid. So I had titers drawn to show immunity ie varicella.
109hkeh,j3ycvtv,jinxxybinxx,2023-01-11 22:23:33,1,Polio and Hep A.
109hkeh,j415rg0,Taytoh3ad,2023-01-12 13:39:03,1,Depends where you are. I just tried to get titers for polio and they no longer do them here. Had to just go ahead and get a booster dose.
109hkeh,j3ydk0i,bluereocheese,2023-01-11 22:27:42,1,"oh okay, was the next dose date after you started practicum? hopefully my instructor will allow that"
109hkeh,j415txs,BenzieBox,2023-01-12 13:39:35,3,They should still try instead of just.. not.
109hkeh,j3yyr9d,DrinkExcessWater,2023-01-12 00:48:52,1,"Same experience with my program.  A few of my classmates didn't finish their vaccines or titers done before the program started.  Our professors said they needed to be done before clinicals, which were several weeks later.

Show your professors you've got your vaccine lined up.  Hopefully they'll understand.  It'd be an unwise business decision to not accept all the money they can get from you just for a missed vaccine haha!"
109hkeh,j4166vx,Taytoh3ad,2023-01-12 13:42:27,1,"Totally agree! This was more of a reply meant for op, apparently my thumbs don’t discern very well. Just letting op know they may just end up being boosted"
109hkeh,j3z6g5o,bluereocheese,2023-01-12 01:42:36,1,what happened with your friends were they able to continue with clinicals?
109hkeh,j3z6nmw,DrinkExcessWater,2023-01-12 01:44:04,1,Yes.
10s1afq,j6zav9l,Public_Championship9,2023-02-02 23:09:25,1,"That sounds like not a great idea. When you go to clinical, the idea is that you’re under the guidance and direction of your nursing instructor. If you’re finding your own site, you’d be going in alone I suppose? And the school just thinks that a nurse on the unit will take ownership of you? I’m not sure that too many unit nurses would be agreeable to this since it’s not like you’ve been hired and are orienting to the unit, you’ve not passed the nclex yet. 

I don’t really think that any hospitals would agree to this but in order to find out, I’d suggest you email the hospital’s HR department to see if they enter into agreements such as this."
10s1afq,j7868mf,joelupi,2023-02-04 20:35:09,1,"A lot of online BSN and Post Grad programs make you find your own clinical sites so this isn't too too foreign.

Start asking around at any hospitals you may have had clinicals at before or worked at. Ask friends and family. Post about it on social. See if there are any Facebook groups for youe program or nursing in your relative locale.  Look on sites or subreddits specific to your area to see if anyone has had any good (or bad experiences) with particular hospitals.

It's going to be a lot of pounding the pavement and cold calling people."
10s1afq,j6zdrzg,kesigoqn,2023-02-02 23:29:30,0,Hmmm... valid points. Thank you. I'll throw some emails out there and see what happens.

10h20zm,j57e7a9,Apprehensive_Lime841,2023-01-20 22:34:31,4,"I’d suggest reviewing: 

-Pools (ex. what circumstances would warrant a pool closure, safety equipment that must be available at pools, steps to close a pool where a health hazard exists)

-Rabies (ex. the purpose of a Rabies management program, what types of questions would you ask a caller who reports that they were bitten, what is the purpose of the 14-day confinement period? What happens if the animal dies during the 14-day confinement period?)

-Food Safety (ex. What circumstances would warrant a restaurant closure? How would you go about closing a restaurant if a health hazard exists? Know the temperature range for hot holding and cold-holding potentially hazardous foods, as well as the temperature danger zone. Review what steps you’d take if you observed a potentially hazardous at room temperature during a regular compliance inspection) 

-BWA (ex. What is a BWA? When are they issued? What advice what you provide to an operator whose food premise is under a BWA?)

10h20zm,j56a6it,KillaKV10,2023-01-20 18:18:42,3,"A practicum here in Canada is a requirement for students who want to become public health inspectors. Typically done during the summer for 4 months after we complete our program. We need to get a certain number of hours in order to take our board of certification exam in October. So currently I am applying for those summer student positions and I just wanted to be familiar with what kind of interview questions they ask such as food inspection, rabies, safe water etc just to be prepared for my interview."
10h20zm,j56e57v,BrilliantLopsided250,2023-01-20 18:43:27,5,"Oh gotcha! So I did several internships and now am a health inspector in the US. 

The biggest thing that really isn’t talked about but always discussed in interviews and in the first segment of employment is communication. This job is very public facing. You interact with so many personalities and how you explain the science is just as important as knowing it. 

-how do you diffuse a tense situation with an uncooperative person?
-what techniques do you use to educate people? (Age, cultural, language, etc) do you use media, written information, translation apps, etc?
-this is a very independent job, how do you manage time and organize your day? 

-go on the municipalities websites and look at what issues they post about, what forms are available, what are they most concerned about? That will tell you a lot regarding what they care about
-know the biggest concerns regarding whatever the bigger public health concerns (water quality and food borne outbreaks) and focus on epidemiology. You don’t have to be an expert; stay broad. 
-look up good sampling and documentation techniques for any water quality stuff you might have to do

Just remember, they’re not expecting you to be an expert or know everything about the job. So if you can discuss a little bit about the range of topics and importantly have a great attitude, professionalism, you’re golden"
ze31yi,iz4oqz7,super_senior_,2022-12-06 13:35:30,91,"Guess what? You’re not good and you’re not supposed to be yet, so relax and trust the process. You’re learning and it’d be more problematic if you were a practicum student already thinking you had it all figured out.

Editing to add I had a full on mental breakdown after my first day seeing patients as a licensed associate. It’s good that you’re taking it seriously enough to be scared, but don’t stop pushing yourself forward."
ze31yi,iz4lulm,None,2022-12-06 13:08:25,30,"Do a search of imposter syndrome on this sub. Being a therapist is super tough, especially when first starting. Try to trust your training and go with it."
ze31yi,iz53evf,Cleverusername531,2022-12-06 15:29:41,17,"I use Internal Family Systems so this sounds to me like an inner critic polarized with a perfectionist part of you, all protecting you from something they’re scared of you experiencing."
ze31yi,iz4q778,Wooden_Painting3672,2022-12-06 13:48:13,15,I did feel this way.  It’s the learning curve and there is a lot more to come.  You typically would address this with your supervisor.  A lot of therapy is talking and building rapport with clients.  You don’t have to know every intervention or assessment.
ze31yi,iz58n0v,theunkindpanda,2022-12-06 16:05:11,11,"Yes! Of course everyone’s definition of “severe” may vary, but I definitely experienced high anxiety in school. I think it’s a combination of doing something very new but also very important. You’re learning your flow, your muscle memory of sorts, and it’ll take a while and lots of practice before you feel comfortable with it. 

I found it helpful to invest what little extra time I had in hobbies and goofing off with friends when I could. Invest in things that are designed to be silly or fun to give your mind a break."
ze31yi,iz5a0lv,angel_dusted,2022-12-06 16:14:33,9,"I did my practicum in a residential treatment center and got tossed about 4 groups and 10 clients. I had no idea what I was doing for either of them. Impostor syndrome is particularly strong at that point, but what you're going through is normal. Just be genuine and don't think too much about applying theory and things like that. You're in the right spot, we all have doubts."
ze31yi,iz5q41v,6ravo2ulu,2022-12-06 17:58:21,8,"First things first - breathe deeply. You're not supposed to know it all yet. And, even when you graduate, you're a noobie in this complicated and emotionally-draining field. It is 10000% AOK to feel like you're feeling. Imposter syndrome is legit, and this pressure you're feeling to already be efficient and effective is normal.

Second - your supervisors should never be stacking your caseload with more than is expected for a practicum student. If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to your supervisor and make your voice heard. It is NOT ok for supes to burn out their students. It is not cool to give a massive caseload to a practicum student or intern. It's just not. IMHO too many promising mental health pros get treated this way. Self-advocacy is important to learn early on in this field.

Lastly - a reminder that you're doing fine and exactly where you need to be if you're feeling like these. We've all been there. It does get better. Breathe deep and talk openly to your supervisor, at length, for as long as necessary. Good on you for getting into counseling, too. Our jobs can be pretty hard at times. And, for real - it's gonna be ok. Everyone hates case notes. EVERYONE. 

Be well.

Edit for clarity."
ze31yi,iz66z0n,kranberrysauce12,2022-12-06 19:46:10,8,"First, breath. 

Next all anyone wants is to feel heard, seen and validated. You can do that. That takes just listening and supporting. Once you feel somewhat more confident in that then practice some of the skills, CBT is great when starting. 

It’s about expectations management. Don’t expect yourself to be great. Expect yourself to be present in the session and continue to learn and grow and be in the process.

I have practiced for 12 years, i oversee interns now. The ones who are scared and recognize it’s hard are the ones willing to grow.

And guess what, sometimes I wish I could see my first patients again and tell them “look, I better at this now”, but you know what I think most of the would say, you listened and didn’t judge"
ze31yi,iz5dsn5,SpiritMercurius,2022-12-06 16:39:53,5,"Although it’s distressing, the fact that you are humble and take how challenging the work is is a good sign! If you were super confident I’d be concerned. You are there to learn though , not perform perfectly. I hate how interns or practicum students are considered free labor and not recognized as in a learning role. Please take good care, it will get easier."
ze31yi,iz5gm1a,Moon_In_Scorpio,2022-12-06 16:58:15,10,"I felt the same way starting my practicum this year. One thing that comes to my mind as I read your story, is that you have been in your practicum since August and these feelings are still lingering at the same intensity. In my case, it was a trauma response to getting in trouble and the fear of not feeling adequate enough as a person. I actually did some work through EMDR on this, and it was really helpful. I had some formative experiences where within an evaluative of environment,. I was berated several times. This left a very hyper vigilant /high anxiety anticipation towards not getting in trouble for me that really reared it’s head during practicum. If this resonates with you, getting therapy yourself will be helpful. If that’s not finically viable, there are several workbooks that are on perfectionism that might be useful."
ze31yi,iz5yeie,Calmdownblake,2022-12-06 18:50:53,3,"Exactly how I felt during my practicum last year!! Confidence and expertise will come with time. My supervisor had told me that now it is great to get the experience and flow of working with clients, and you’ll feel more comfortable expanding your horizons with new techniques etc in the future after you’ve had more trainings and experience. In short, focus now on validating the client’s experience and building rapport. More will come later. :) one step at a time! All the other practicum students felt the same way as me, too. So that was really reassuring. You got this! Just keep consulting with your supervisor anytime you have questions. They’re a great resource."
ze31yi,iz5swav,disheveledfuck,2022-12-06 18:15:52,2,"Hi! Fellow practicum trainee here, also started seeing clients in August. Now that I’m 4 months in with a similar caseload, the anxiety still lingers for me but it’s not nearly as severe as it was when I first got started. Talking to my supervisor and my peers helped alleviate most of the anxiety. Honestly just getting the sense of “you are not alone” really helped. And I’ll repeat that to you; You are not alone. We’re like babies learning how to walk and talk for the first time. It’s going to be difficult at first but we’ve gotta be patient with ourselves and we’ll eventually get the hang of it. Take it easy on yourself and please don’t be afraid to reach out for guidance or validation."
ze31yi,iz6bpq0,tofu-cutie,2022-12-06 20:16:12,1,"I was the exact same way when I was in my practicum. I had to meditate and do breathing exercises before leading my groups just so I felt like I had it together! I had the same fear of not being cut out for this work. Turns out, as funny as it is, I work really well with those experiencing anxiety/anxiety disorders because I myself understand a lot of the symptoms from having an anxiety disorder and can sometimes put things into words that clients are feeling, but can't yet explain. 
Someone echoed this already, but a piece of advice I was given by a colleague was ""you're still in school and you're pre-license. Legally, you aren't competent."" Which sounds kind of unhelpful, but it lifted a weight off my chest knowing not everyone in the world expected me to be a guru in my first session. 
Every time you see a client or do a group, some of that anxiety will melt away and slowly you'll build a clinical confidence. 
It's really hard work at first, but these are only growing pains!"
ze31yi,iz7cfe7,lil8mochi,2022-12-07 00:27:31,1,Man I feel like this still! Haha nah it does get better with time. You're still training but you're always going to be learning.
ze31yi,iz7jgfr,Goodsoup_666,2022-12-07 01:20:58,1,"I feel for you !! I think most people feel this way, especially bc no education can prepare you for the actual experience. We care and we want to do the best for our clients, and over time you’ll realize that all they want is someone present w them. 

You will do great and it’s okay to be an anxious mess. You’re on your way to becoming the person you saw yourself being when you first went into grad school ❤️

The best thing I ever did was catch myself when I started to get in my head about formulating the perfect response or question back- just come out and be yourself. The skills will follow."
ze31yi,iz7kjfi,sportylavalamps,2022-12-07 01:29:18,1,"I graduate from my CMHC master's program in 11 days Woohoo!! Reading this really brought me back to practicum earlier this year. When I say I was anxious in practicum and internship 1, I mean I SEVERELY anxious. I felt like I was going crazy- it was that bad. I was in constant  fight or flight for a majority of the time- much more than my peers. You are not alone and it gets better.  
In reality, we are all anxious with this. We aren't supposed to have this thing figured out. We are students. Let this be the time to learn, ask all the questions, make mistakes, and grow. Imposter syndrome is a bitch- especially in the mental health field. It's hard to be an expert on wellness when you aren't feeling well yourself. This experience is going to help you grow so much as a clinician, but also help you grow in ways to manage your anxiety and your expectations of yourself. Good luck, you're gonna do great. Feel free to PM me!"

10twxw3,j79hmpn,SensitiveSharkk,2023-02-05 02:40:37,3,"You could focus on the different methods that women used to protest and organize. The Declaration of Sentiments, they had parades, speeches, and of course the hunger strikes that women went on while imprisoned.

PBS has an interactive on women's suffrage you could use as an activity. I used it this year. 

https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/vote-she-resisted/

You could also have students compare the Declaration of Sentiments with the Declaration of Independence. 

Or you could combine them all with blended learning. I really like using blended learning. It's where you divide students into 3 groups. One group doing something with you, one group doing something on paper, and another doing something online. If I were you, I'd do some sort of small group lecture with 1 group, have 1 group do the comparison with the 2 declarations, then have the other do something with the interactive I linked above. 30 minutes at each station. Boom you just killed a 90 block period.

For PhD level, usually a research collaboration needs to be established by your advisor Typically you would have a specific aim (e.g. Learning a new method) before you go. This is because supervising a PhD is a lot more work, and they can’t just hand you a PhD-level project for the summer."

10ljj3p,j5yt1a7,hellomondays,2023-01-26 14:45:09,3,"I did two internships in inpatient settings (Music Therapy certification is weird but it led me to MH counseling so that's that!) and have worked in inpatient for 5 years now. I have never worked in an inpatient setting where there wasn't constant concerns for staff safety and a feeling like the administration was neglecting staff concerns. It goes with the turf, there's a lot of massive structural problems with inpatient mental health care. However, you learn quickly the little safety tricks that keep everyone (staff clients visitors) safe. I think our field has a natural advantage since so much of our training is put on learning non-verbal cues. Plus, by ethics you always have the right to deny services if you feel that there's a safety concern that can't be fixed right away. For example I've had to cancel groups when there couldn't be a floor staff in the room with us. 

That said, I sincerely believe that everyone in this field should get some experience with short term inpatient settings. You'll meet a wide variety of clients and other disciplines and learn the patience and how to be flexible in your clinical skills to work with both. It can feel like a baptism by fire at times but the sheer volume and diversity in issues you'll work with will serve you well in whatever setting you end up in."
10ljj3p,j5z3hst,Training_Sail_5996,2023-01-26 15:55:00,2,"I worked in a long term care facility for severe and persistently ill clients. I worked there out of college and was fortunate enough to do my practicum there when I went back to grad school.  

If someone asked me if you have to worry about violence working there the answer would be yes. It's a possibility given the nature of the diagnoses and clients. 

We were constantly trained and retrained in non violent skills for crisis intervention, de escalation techniques and other skills of the type.

I was told on my first day if you can make it there you can work anywhere.  I've since worked in outpatient community mental health and now private practice.  It's absolutely true. It prepared me for anything I might see in an outpatient setting.

I learned more there (I did work there for 14 years) than anywhere else I've worked. 

My supervisors were a huge part of that as I learned as much about myself as I did the clients and diagnoses.

I'd ask about what kinds of training they provide. What is their restraint policy? Those types of questions.

Inpatient work is its own universe but I think everyone should have some experience working in one.  

Good luck!"

Just roll with it and make the best of it because that's what you'll have to do every year teaching special education. One year might be easy-breezy, but the next year might leave you exhausted. The year after that, you might have the parents from hell. Just learn to roll with it. 

Talk to your dean or professors now about ensuring you get an elementary placement the next time. You do need the exposure to know if you'd like elementary or not. I always thought I'd stick with young adults, but ended up working with preschoolers and love it."
10g3hue,j51ocho,INFJBrain,2023-01-19 19:52:13,2,"I would say do the placement and get what you can from that experience. Every placement will be very different, and while others might be able to share experiences with each other, you might learn something that they dont get to. 

I initially went to university to be a elementary school teacher, then switched to sped (k-12) and post graduation I've worked in all different grade levels with all different types of needs. I think the more varied experiences you can get early on the better. 

My sped placement was actually in a behavior intervention classroom (k-5). No one else in the university was or had done a placement in that setting but looking back, it was an amazing experience to have had, the things I learned there really shaped some of my teaching style."
10g3hue,j55ledq,joantheunicorn,2023-01-20 15:44:01,2,"I agree with others that have said you should just roll with it. You will learn new things at each placement and honestly the things you learn that you might take from one placement to another might surprise you. Learning to ""roll with it"" might be one of the most valuable lessons for becoming a special Ed teacher, IMO.

 For example, I was going along just fine this year this year with my usual courses (my 17th year of teaching special Ed?? I don't recall, lol) and this week I got a new reading class dumped in my lap! We start Tuesday! I have to magically make it happen. 🤪"

Do you have any child life specific experiences? I think during my practicum I had alrrady taken 5 or 6 of the child life courses online at UCSB Extension, and had started my Master's (online also).

The only practicum locations are Calgary, Medicine Hat, red deer and Lethbridge - but you don’t change cities, you’re there the whole time. There is obviously a chance you could get placed somewhere you don’t want to (that’s why they make you sign stuff like four times before getting in to cover their butts and silence your complaints). People can still theoretically trade cities or they’ll toss out a spot for everyone to draw from if someone drops out before they finalize. But technically speaking there’s no guarantees."

May have made breakthroughs in the scientific / scientific community around love & sex Venus Pluto in Gemini along with Lilith aqua 10.  I see this person being a pioneer of subconscious studies with Saturn in 12th house.

2. This may be someone who is a romantic, poetic, musician / artist or a wonderful writer Cancer Mercury in 3 along with Neptune. With a pretty active personal life that is geared around the town they live in. Active with neighbors even though can be quite private and reclusive.

3 personality is outwardly social, but with a deep internal world. Pluto in Gemini, so this person clearly isn’t around anymore and was alive during the Second World War I believe - just guesstimating off the top of my head. 
That’s my final call!

When will you post the name?"
ycezr0,itp9llh,rectovrso,2022-10-25 09:15:18,5,"1. What was the native known for?

Pluto in Gemini, meaning this person was born in the early 1900s. Uranus in his MC, this person was revolutionary, a trailblazer and in 2 degree means that he/she was the best of the best in his field. Uranus also represent shocking innovation so maybe related to science and tech, my guess it could be related to an invention that is revolutionary during his time. MC in Aquarius - this person was an independent thinker (and the modern ruler Uranus is in MC too) so I really think this was someone in technology sector. Since Aquarius is also about tech and innovation. 

2. Personality & Personal Life

I will just focus on a few things that caught my attention.

Saturn in 12th house which is..yikes, IMO. 12th house governs the unseen realm like secrets, dreams, subconscious and Saturn is about virtues, values, karma, justice. Saturn also is a hard teacher in a sense. Saturn in 12th house shows that this person might have an internal conflict(?) regarding his virtues or something. I really think this was an introverted person that learnt to push aside their emotions. So I think this person might be a lonely person inside. Supported by Chiron in 11th house

Moon in 6th house, located very near with South Node, this person might have problem with maternal figure. Venus conjunct Pluto, I think this person expression of love can be intense. 

Lilith in Aquarius. Lilith is our darkest demons that we repressed and Aquarius is a sign that demands freedom and can be quite eccentric. Since Lilith usually relates to sexual expression, maybe there’s something about this person sexual expression that is unconventional. Maybe. And it’s in 10th house, so this might be something that gained a reputation as well? Beside career. 

Other than that, I see a sensitive person that was smart and curious."

Other than the trine to Saturn, Uranus has no connection to the rest of the chart but is tightly conjunct the MC giving me a feeling he was known for doing something ahead of his time, radical or eccentric. Most likely his reputation was very different than the way he really feels himself to be (isolated Uranus at the top of the chart; personal planets clustered in the 1st quadrant). 

Personal life - Venus conjunct Pluto Gemini - something scandalous perhaps? This aspect creates some drama, and combined with the confident Mars Leo, romantic Libra moon, and 7th house Jupiter suggest relationships were an important part of his life.

Who is it? I have no idea!! But I do know that he's dead (pluto gemini) and probably born in the UK or northern latitude due to the house inequality."
ycezr0,itmbdy6,Jonnuska,2022-10-24 18:19:48,6,"I will try my luck here 🙈:

1. Native was probably known as someone who either went from rags to riches and/or riches to rags (2nd house Pluto). It feels like the Jupiter in 7th house could indicate they married a wealthy person and that may be the rags to riches story here. Or they had other very succesful partnership. 

For their profession/public image it’s likely done in an original and rebellious way (Uranus in 10th). Could be that it’s also a sign of a big sweeping change (from rags to riches).
 I feel that Mercury and Neptune in the 3rd house gives this individual a great sense of imagination, even thought not tightly in conjunction. Maybe this person is/was an author? Regardless i feel like they have their way with the words. 

2. Pluto/Venus conjunctions don’t go usually unnoticed, and if they married a wealthy person the money and resources most likely have been a power struggle in their relationship. Even in a work related partnership. 

3. Saturn that is so joyful in the 12th house is a sign of some sort of an alienation and maybe loneliness. I might be overthinking here but it feels like there is a paradox of being so original and electrifying in world’s eyes (Uranus in 10th) and yet feeling so restricted within (Saturn in 12th). I feel like there could be a tradegy in his life because of this. 
Moon in the 6th house brings health related worries that could be associated with the Saturn in 12th house. 
He is/was obsessed with wealth (sun and pluto in 2nd house)."
ycezr0,itp3z0x,Inner_Compass_,2022-10-25 07:52:53,2,"(1) MC in Aquarius conjunct Uranus with Mercury as chart ruler: Science/or Technology. They worked in a field that was niche or innovative. Or they took a different approach to an already established field. Possibly a teacher?

Saturn/MC tells me there is something “structural” or standard about the career or career environment — an established institution. If we consider Saturn as the institution (where work is occurring) esp. as it’s in the 12th, the institution could be hidden, not easily recognizable, or ancient. Not applicable to this but I’m thinking Free Mason or a private order. 

Saturn (institution) in the 12th (hidden) with an expression in Aries/Taurus. Finance? Military? Agriculture? The illuminati? 🙃

(2) Varied love affairs. Chart ruler quincunx 7th House ruler difficulty reconciling his life direction, which appears to center around this person’s work, and private life. Chiron in Neptune square DSC makes me think this person had difficulty connecting with others. Not just platonically, but also romantically. 

(3) Personality: Meticulous especially when it comes to his work. Workaholic. Eccentric or perceived as eccentric. They were stubborn. This person was different and this differentness caused them pain, a pain which began in childhood. Chiron in 11th, Saturn in 12th, Ruler of 12th in 4th. Enjoys learning which tells me he knew many disciplines. The 6x12 axis tells me this is someone who likes to be of service — solving problems."
ycezr0,iu3li9s,LOVEPEACEW33D,2022-10-28 08:52:35,2,"1. The native is known for technological advancement.
2. They may come across flirty, they love the attention but once they're in a relationship, they're committed and quite possessive. Mental connection is important. Their type is foreign, stylish, nerdy, quirky, loves traveling. 
3. Likable, humanitarian, persistent and passionate about what they do & what they believe in, sentimental and emotional but don't show it often, can be manipulative, perhaps a little people-pleasing. They look younger then they are."
ycezr0,iu6evou,clarkinia,2022-10-28 22:11:29,2,"What was the native known for? Preaching their trademarked gospel. Indulgent and expressive, could take a contradictory stance on morals, emotions and material things. They feel like they know ""the right way"" but then don't always practice what they preach. They could be known for leadership or talent, definitely involces them expressing themseles (ideas or music) to make human emotional connection.  
What was his personal life like? Connecting with people they want to rise with. Relationships with other well-known people who share big ambitions. Also, messy, as in people who easily flash at each other, but also fun, adventurous, exciting, expressive communication styles and gossip-ridden.   
How would you describe his personality? Magnetic personality. Gift of gab. Extroverted with a fair amount of thin skin. Can dish it but can't take it. Likes lavish things, comforts of this world."
ycezr0,itmh3aw,EuphoricToe1,2022-10-24 18:56:01,5,"I'll be reading the chart via Whole Sign! And, as always, I'm a beginner and very open to constructive feedback.

1. For what the native is known for- another Aquarius 9H MC! With Uranus in retrograde and Lilith right there as well- wowza. Unfortunately I'm not very familiar with significations of Lilith so I won't be able to meaningfully incorporate that into an analysis, at least beyond a vague ""perhaps an aspect of what the native is well known for involves issues with women or sexuality"" (though that feels like a really shallow understanding of Lilith). So at least with retrograde Uranus there- being in the 9H, this screams of intellectual discovery to me. Maybe a revolutionary social ideology, with Aquarius hosting. I see the 9H ruler, Saturn, is in Taurus in the 12H and is trining that Uranus- maybe the social ideology had to do with prison reform, or mental health care reform, or the advocacy or another marginalized group? With Taurus, maybe there was an element advocating for these groups to maintain a good quality of life amidst their isolation? To add in the 10H to this- with Pisces ruling and Jupiter retrograde in the 7H in its other domicile (Sagittarius) in a relatively tight conjunction with the DC, and Chiron retrograde in the 10H, this suggests to me that the native's notoriety and the dissemination of their philosophy was somehow personally healing to them, and maybe involved some sort of externalization of their inner experience as well.
2. For their personal life, I would look towards the 4H, which through Whole Sign is ruled by Virgo. The native's Mercury is in the 2H in Cancer, which is also where their Sun is (though they aren't conjunct). This, to me, conveys a sense of guardedness and protection, particularly with resources and how the personal life is shifted/changed. (Which would be interesting if indeed there was some element of the native's personal life made public as part of what brought them notoriety, as above.) The ruler of their Sun and Mercury, the Moon, is in their Libra 5H and conjunct their S Node, which to me reads as an enjoyment of hosting small gatherings at home. Additionally, their IC is in Leo in their 3H- with its ruler in Cancer, this furthers the theme for me of protection of the home life yet opening it up in small, measured ways.
3. For some qualities of their personality, a Gemini AC would indicate to me a person who enjoys good conversation, intellectual pursuits, and dislikes sticking to one endeavor for long stretches of time. With the ruler of the AC being that 2H Cancer Mercury, this to me adds a layer of mixed temperance- maybe they get emotionally caught up in their debates and find themselves greatly affected by them, especially when their personal values are at stake. Venus and Pluto conjunct in Gemini in the 1H is an interesting combo, suggesting to me a certain magnetism and attractiveness that is tinged with a willingness to go deep in a sort of intense way.

I love these practicums!! So helpful to learn. Looking forward to hearing what others have to say!"
ycezr0,itmthbe,lilliathings,2022-10-24 20:16:03,5,"Native was a Cancer Sun, Libra Moon, Gemini Ascendant. Born late early into Gemini Pluto generation (or is that early Cancer?). This person, likely dead, would be more than 100 years old today. 

They have 4 intercepted signs, within the 12/6 houses along the Taurus/Scorpio axis, and within 11/5 houses along the Pisces/Virgo axis.

They likely could not express themselves fully in their lifetime, or if they did they were ostracized for it. 

With an Mc in Aquarius, they’re likely an odd ball with a reputation for being eccentric or quirky. Especially with Uranus conjunct the MC (within sign of domicile no less). 

With a Sagittarius 7H Jupiter (also in domicile) on the DC- relationships are likely of utmost importance to this individual, they grow and expand within the parameters of their partnerships."
ycezr0,itn3qx5,astrogirl127,2022-10-24 21:22:02,2,"1. Known for having an unconventional career/ possibly invented something and ppl thought it was crazy/no one had seen anything like it before (uranus conjunct mc in aquarius in 9h). Could have had to do with having abnormal spiritual beliefs, getting some cult leader vibes. 
2. Personal life- social and larger than life, but also may have believed he was always right about who should do what/how ppl should act, wanted a lot of attention in romantic relationships, may have been a committment-phobe (jupiter conjunct dc in sagittarius in 7h). Seen as a doer, having friends and just going out and doing anything, taking leaps, definitely the type to approach others first (aries in 11h with NN there). Could be very controlling in romantic relationships or want love that would be very deep/transformative (venus conjunct pluto)
3. personality- very magnetic/power hungry or seen as powerful (sun conjunct pluto). Very social/talkative when he/she first meets people, may be a player in relationships (gemini venus 1H). Could also have a more emotional side that is hidden (cancer planets, hidden bc pluto conjunct sun). Definitely was important for this person to have friends/be recognized by others."
ycezr0,itnbwng,siren5474,2022-10-24 22:19:14,2,"1. What was the native known for?  
Uranus right on the MC is the first thing that jumps out. That combo happening in aquarius makes me think that the primary word to describe his publicized personality is eccentric. Not afraid to champion his cause. That's a huge factor. To get into the details though, saturn rules his MC and jupiter rules his 10th whole sign house. with saturn being the most difficult planet in the chart and in the 12th house, he either had a very public banishment, imprisonment, or debilitating illness. Saturn definitely will give him a hard time, and the spotlight being put on him was done for the way he dealt with saturnian hardships. The MC is in the terms of mercury, so their career was enacted through the mercurial lens of education, shows them to be a public philanthropist, and dealing with the law. Jupiter rules the 10th whole sign house, and so attempting to bring stability and peace to the world was his main goal, i imagine. this all pretty clearly has me thinking he was a political activist of some kind, who definitely faced some extreme suffering to make them believe what they believe.   
2. What was his personal life like?  
It seems like romance was a reasonably good and pleasant thing in his life, with domicile jupiter on the setting angle. venus as the natural ruler of relationships will also indicate the nature of his love life. in a mutable sign, he probably had multiple marriages. combust, his relationships were probably overshadowed or difficult to find.   
the fourth house signifies the parents, with IC being especially sensitive here. uranus opposes the IC and so the converse plays out with his parents: they stifled his uranian urge to fight for his cause somehow. with the IC in the terms of jupiter, his parents actually probably were quite lenient and generous to him; that doesn't mean he didn't feel like he couldn't pursue his vision with them though. the ruler of the 4th whole sign house is mercury in cancer, so his parents were very reactive to him yet still somewhat cold and calculating. he might have felt their influence in waves, not all at once or oppressively.   
3. How would you describe his personality?  
The ascendant being in gemini, he was most likely the impish archetype of gemini. quick to chime in with other perspectives, and to facilitate the voices of others being understood. the ascendant in a term of mercury means that he is emphatically intelligent, skilled, poetic, and versatile. he is a very mercurial figure, personality wise. as this is a night chart, the moon is the luminary of sect and probably a little more visible in his personality than the sun. libra moon indicates that his intuition operates in the interest of fairness, and when he engages emotionally it's by bringing up another viewpoint to try and make things more equitable and broadly understood. finally, with a cancer sun being the tertiary consideration of the big 3, he was trying to build his vision via following the threads of intuition that his libra moon lays down. he attempts to shed light on things by following his gut reaction to them.   


hopefully this was a good first attempt! whoever this dude is seems really interesting at least!"
ycezr0,itm9l36,lolingsauce,2022-10-24 18:08:15,2,I'm noob at astrology. This person seems to be some kind of mystic with a large following.
ycezr0,itnfy5o,Anomenly,2022-10-24 22:49:32,1,"My first thought is that this person found healing (and earns a living) as they communicated about pain they've experienced in their romantic relationships.

\- Mercury (ASC ruler) trine Chiron, Jupiter retrograde most angular on DSC square Chiron, Mercury in 2nd house, Moon as 2nd whole sign house ruler conjunct south node in Libra

To elaborate on that, perhaps they were known for communicating above love in a unique and powerful way, perhaps there are some issues around women's power/agency surrounding this person. Perhaps there was something simultaneously powerful and vulnerable about their voice and messaging.

\- Venus in Gemini conjunct Pluto, Uranus on MC conjunct Lilith, Mercury in Cancer

For their personal life, I wonder if they found it hard to get away from their work, like they had to satisfy their audience. May have felt natural for them to integrate their personal life and work life.

\- Mars in 4th house ruling 6th and 11th whole sign houses. Mercury as the ruler of the 1st and 4th whole sign house trine Chiron in the 11th too.

As far as personality goes, I would say they've got a fair amount of energy (although it may not look like it on the surface) with a serious gushy/sensitive side; intelligent but more passionate/heart-on-sleeve than calculating.

\- Mercury is the strongest planet in the chart and their temperament is mostly hot and fairly equally wet/dry, Saturn is conjunct the ASC.

Gonna go with a musical career for my first guess, a song-writer and a unique performer, with heavy love-and-loss/heartbreak themes.

\- all of the above reasonings, plus Saturn in Venus' sign in the 12th house ruling the MC

1/ Known for secrets and far away places, isolation.  Saturn in the 12th house. Government/organisation/corporate affairs in the place of secrets and hidden things, and isolation, all the while Saturn also rules the 8th and 9th house, cap and aqua.  

Venus in 1st house also rules 12th.

&#x200B;

Parents worked abroad a lot while the kids stayed in England.  

&#x200B;

2/ not gonna say much cos that will give it away but I find interesting that Jupiter on the dsc in sag should manifest the way it did in his life.  Jupiter often points to faith and religious beliefs.  This fellow was an atheist in real life though.  I find that 7th house placement show how we are challenged by associates and partners. 

Bizarrely though, this person believed in fortune tellers.  I believe that he struggled with and was challenged by spiritual beliefs.

Here are my astro reasons for the above delineation: 

Preachy about their unique ideas bc of fixed Aqua MC ruled by fixed Taurus Saturn. In the 12th, I pictured Saturn in Taurus struggling with materialism/ values. Ironically amplified by a 2nd house stellium. I wasn't sure if they would have a creative talent with a full 2nd house, ruled by a Moon-south node in 5th and NN ruled by a Mars in Leo. But being an inventor is its own kind of talent. I feel like the 12th house would indicate what they may have invented (something for the home? maybe based on their own experiences of ""going without"" as a child?)

Relationships connected to ambitions because of Jupiter in Sag on DC. And the other Jupiter-ruled house is the 10th house. I thought of personal relationships being messy (and/or exciting) because of angular Mars in Leo near IC in 3rd house, where I could see a lot of brash expression and gossipyness that could lead to hurt feelings (and with a Cancer stellium there isn't a lot of earth to stabilize in these instances). Ditto with angular Venus together with Pluto in Gemini. 

Venus/ Pluto in Gemini 1st. And the Cancer stellium led me to believe they are extroverted but sensitive, needing safety and comfort - so cdependent in that way.

This so much fun - I wanna know."

Unless, he did something for like public health in terms of epidemiology or maybe even surgery. Those are less nurturing and more investigative. 

I put Grand in quotes because I know that aspect is typically for planetary configurations.

I also think it’s more significant in terms of their career being something for the greater good of humanity because of Part of Fortune being in 10th House Aqua, rather than say something like entertainment or the arts because Leo is intercepted- though certainly I know that Leo placements aren’t the only ones noted for entertainment, but with Venusian Taurus intercepted as well I doubt it’s art either."

I don't see Saturn playing a large role in this chart, as it's also sort of isolated.  

This is somebody who was not 'at one' with himself.  

He has a strong focus on one thing only. (5 planets within 30 degrees including sun). Maybe he is a rebel/revolutionary but there is also an introverted quiet tone to this chart. (emphasis on 1st quadrant)

As in, they are competitive like jobs. Projects are still industry sponsored and everything, it ends up being closer to a contractor relationship versus being the sponsor's employee. But, you will get at least one of the two. Some projects had the number of students expanded so that nobody went without anything. It's turned out to be close to a 50/50 split on everyone getting a project or practicum."

I'll be starting the ADP at the same time as you! See you on campus this Fall!  


That's also a question I was concerned about and I spoke to a lot of program staff and alums about it before I applied. You are NOT guaranteed a practicum. They are competitive, and are handled basically like job applications in that your application will be reviewed and decided by the group you're trying to work with. I think BCIT tries to promote it like there is a a practicum spot per student (or close to it), but that doesn't seem to be the case.  


Two other useful things I did learn, though:  
If you want a practicum, you don't have to apply from their list of approved ones. If you can coordinate with some organization that's willing to sponsor you for the practicum, it's possible to get that arrangement approved and overseen like one of the pre-approved ones. So that could be an option if you happen to have some connections going in.  
Also, it sounds like you might have an edge in practicum applications if you have a background in a field that uses GIS, but is less common among students in the program. Sounds like political science/public policy in particular is a good background to have."

My old school had Sunderland candidates through when I was there as well, (ISF), but only rarely and usually if the person had a connection with the school already. Wouldn’t hurt to shoot them an email though. Never know if you don’t try.

Business casual is not a hard thing to achieve and whatever your budget is you can make it work. Don’t think about it too much, your clients aren’t going to care as long as you look put together. Personally I’d stray away from athletic wear, converse, vans etc. You want to dress like an adult, not like you’re still in high school. Because you’re young people are going to judge you if you don’t look professional. But you definitely don’t need to dress overly feminine and that can even seem a little intimidating to clients.

Even though I did not do it full-time, I have been able to register for 5 classes if I wanted to.

Anyway it is still possible to complete in 1 year if you are willing to grind it out and/or have taken the micromasters prior.

With 7 classes left, you only need to complete at least 5 more classes for the first 2 semesters with DVA and DAB included and then the practicum + the remaining classes.

I do actually have a project groupmate who has already completed 5 in her first semester as a full-time student so it is definitely feasible."

I think if you review what you've done in studios so far and understand how to derive the important relationships, you'll be good overall"

ztph8d,j1h9g8s,moonbeam127,2022-12-24 09:25:52,3,"Nope, you are an intern, not a pre-licensed employee.  An intern is just that, an intern. Its a no strings attached deal, you show up do you thing and go on your way if you want.  Now your hours of supervision can be different but again, you are employed not enslaved.  Most states are 'employment at will' so even if there is a contract (red flag, illegal) you can quit anyway."
ztph8d,j1fh9n5,all-the-pretties,2022-12-23 22:54:48,1,"It's not necessarily standard, but it isn't uncommon for a site that takes on students to ask for a commitment. I've seen lots of 1-year commitments and a fair amount of 2-year ones. There is quite a bit that goes into training a brand-new therapist, so from the agency's side, I can understand these requirements, especially in this case when they will need to pay your supervisor. That's a specific expense incurred in order for you to train there. Asking for a commitment of some duration isn't necessarily unreasonable, given how they will be investing in you.

That being said: There are many, many aspects of the education and licensure process that are truly unfair to the trainee -- not being paid during internship being a huge one. 

Perhaps you can ask for a shorter term of agreement? Remember that once you're out of school (depending on your state) you may have to pay for your own supervision... Which again, is totally unfair that the system burdens pre-licensed clinicians in this way, but it's how things are at the moment in many areas. You definitely should not have to pay for supervision at this stage of your training.  If this site would be charging full fee for your services while you're in training, then even if they have to pay for supervision, it could be a wash or they could end up doing just fine - but it really depends on how many clients, and again the fee. The fact that you've worked there for years isn't necessarily relevant to these financial considerations since it'll be a different role and relationship.

Lots of moving parts to this, and it's understandable that it feels unfair to you - and, some schools won't allow students to do practicum/internship at places they already work, because it can get quite complicated with the changing roles and often blurry boundaries. I hope you're able to come to an agreement that feels fair. 

One thing to ask about ahead of time if you do decide to do this: What is the policy for allowing your clients to transfer with you to another site or your own private practice at the end of the 2 years? Talk about this upfront and get it in writing (hopefully where it's explicitly allowed). This is not something that most trainees think of ahead of time and it can make for a very difficult transition out later on."

We often get pressure from training sites to stay on because they can pay us less. But to me, it seems unacceptable to do this to a student for a training opportunity they are getting paid to offer."
ztph8d,j1hohi1,CorazonLock,2022-12-24 12:56:33,3,"So in other words, it’s a good thing I am following my gut and abandoning this whole thing with my employer. 😅  I think how much I got told I was being “invested in” then having that coupled with how much they want to do that because I’m a valuable employee is what really gave me the “icks.”"
ztph8d,j1firsi,CorazonLock,2022-12-23 23:06:27,2,"Thank you for the response and validation. I guess maybe it’s the fact they were not upfront in the beginning about signing something. I think making that last minute was what really threw me. And the fact they still haven’t drawn it up. I guess I know what the CW part of things look like, and I’m leery about the entire agency from that - it’s just gone downhill the past year or so. 

It is good to know this is becoming more of the norm, for future reference. I guess my other thought is our agency has been supportive of lateral moves in the company, but they don’t seem to follow through with what they say overall. I guess I’m frustrated. I can do my internships and practicum at different sites, and while I know it takes a lot to train a new therapist, in the same vein, at least with the ACA, they tout pro bono work…so…🤷🏼‍♀️ I just don’t know how they can expect someone to commit not having any idea what they may be getting into.

But really, I’ve been through that in my first 4 years of practice (including internships). Ups and downs. Moments where i leave a session and think “YES! That’s why I became a therapist” and times where I feel like I’m floundering the whole time. Or times when my caseload shrinks and I wonder if I’m effective enough to keep clients committed to the work. Times when I’m energized by a long day because I kicked butt, or exhausted because every session was a slog. 

It is a cycle through those feelings but the nice thing is when you have this wild imposter syndrome, you learn to recognize it for what it is and ask yourself if you’ve just hit one of your growth edges, or if you really just had a hard day like any other therapist has. The feeling of being a fraud gets easier to check against reality over time."

Still stressed but it was easier to manage. The program I chose fit my life a lot better and I worked 4 10 hour shifts at my job so I had more balance. Managing the kid was still tricky.

So I was excited to finally do the job that I wanted to do since undergrad. I got to develop awesome relationships with my coworkers at the clinic and they were wonderfully supportive. My clinical supervisor changed in the middle of my internship, but it was a smooth transition.

The hardest part was that I was working full time at first too. It was too much. I had to drop to part time and rely on my boyfriend to support our bills. And then my health got weird and I started falling asleep randomly (one time almost during a session!!!). I had to drop classes, take a semester break, and graduated a little late.

Overall, it wasn't too bad but it was definitely challenging when I was working full time. It doesn't help that the pandemic happened right as I was about to graduate! So far post-grad has been good but challenging since I work for a non profit. The money isn't what I thought it'd be, so that's frustrating but liveable. I get close to burn out sometimes, but I try to do a lot of self care.

Hope that answered your question :)"

zaq8ii,iyn4g7d,Lonely_Cricket_966,2022-12-02 17:06:09,16,"I know everyone is recommending hwy 1 to Brandon then hwy 10 to minnedosa so as someone who has driven Brandon to minnedosa countless times in winter, the #10 is a narrow windy 2-lane hwy with only a few passing lanes. It is kept as clear as possible in winter due to the large number of travellers between rural areas and Brandon, but can get tricky. The #16 from the junction outside Portage La Prairie is also a 2-lane but has plenty of passing lanes. I personally feel like this 2-lane is wider than the #10 as well making it feel more comfortable for driving. As others have posted just be prepared with emergency stuff in your car to keep you safe and warm in the event of emergency. And remember to always drive to the conditions in the winter meaning slow down if necessary you don’t have to go the max speed limit just cause you can."
zaq8ii,iymxv0p,KaneSC2,2022-12-02 16:22:53,28,"The plan to come back every weekend is probably not the best. There's going to be some times where the highway closes or conditions are miserable. You can plan to come back every weekend, but you'll have to be willing to accept that sometimes that will not happen. 

Get your car checked for a tune-up and make sure it's good to go. Bring warm clothes and blankets in your car, along with a first aid kit and maybe some snacks.

Someone can comment on the route, but in the winter I'd say keep to the highway 1 as much as possible (again, someone else may recommend something better)."

zaq8ii,iyn0u7m,CoryBoehm,2022-12-02 16:42:54,7,"How to save money?

Not sure the cost of your hotel room but I would strongly suggest coming home only alternate weekends or staying there the whole time. The amount you will spend in fuel driving there and back for about 48 hours of time in Winnipeg is likely about the same as the hotel cost. Also the amount of time you will be spending driving on weekends is really going to eat into your downtime from your practicum.

Also having driven through that area very occasionally I would strongly suggest planning your drives so the majority of it happens in daylight hours, ie Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. If you get a little wind and the snow starts blowing even if there isn't accumulation on the roads it makes the drive a fair bit more difficult.

I would say from Minnedosa to Winnipeg you likely want to head to Brandon first and then on HWY 1. Reality of winter highway driving is conditions can change somewhat unexpectedly, especially if you don't have a lot of highway driving experience. The Minnedosa-Brandon-Portage-Winnipeg route gives you some good options if you get stuck part way in your route.The other piece of advice I would suggest for that highway route is to always fill up your tank when you have a chance if you are 3/4 full or less. Yes, you could likely drive one way on a tank without stopping in ideal conditions but all you need to happen is to be down to your last quarter of a tank or less and get stranded.

Also each time before going in the highway do a basic fluid check (washer, oil, etc) and check the tire pressure. It takes a couple minutes but ensures you are less likely to hit the normal issues.

I would suggest having an extra jug of windshield washer fluid in your car and a rag/towel you can use to quickly clean your headlights and taillights if the roads are a little muddy. You may want to consider buying yourself one of those window squeeges too.Look at getting a minimum of jumper cables to have in your vehicle and learn how to hook them up to both start your car from someone else and to start someone else that might need help.

If you don't already have one get a charger for your phone that plugs into the car. Set it to live share your location to a trusted person(s) so someone has your location if there is an issue. As you pass each major city stop for a quick minute even if you don't need fuel and send a contact your current location, the time and your eta to your next check in."
zaq8ii,iyntii0,itsafishal,2022-12-02 19:52:00,4,"Hey, welcome to the neighborhood! Minnedosa and its environs are so beautiful. 

Lots of opinions about routes lol. Here's a locals advice - don't get married to a single route. Highway 16 is sometimes fine, sometimes it's not. I never hesitate to to take it when it's clear (also with a FWD car with winter tires), but will happily redirect to highway 10 or highway 5 when required - use 511 before starting the drive in either direction. 

Bring emergency supplies, as others have recommended, because you should always have those - you have to assume that you could be stuck for hours with no assistance, even if it never actually happens. However, also remember that it's not actually that remote out here! It took my mother ages to not visit with a carload of groceries (we have stores out here mom, you're not going to a remote cottage) - anything you forget, you'll be able to get out here too."

However, in the winter I always recommend Hwy 1 & Hwy 10. Tons of commenter traffic between Brandon and Minnedosa, the roads are always well maintained up to the Russell exit. 

I find Hwy 16 to be more of a dangerous route in the winter. That commercial traffic (big semi trucks) is intense and can be a nightmare to navigate.

zaq8ii,iyn3y9u,CoryBoehm,2022-12-02 17:03:06,2,">I purchased a car portable jump starter 2 years ago and I guess it was a good investment.

I would still strongly suggest having jumper cables even if you have a plug-in jump pack. Needing to use it and finding it needs to be recharged will ruin your day in a hurry. Jumper cables don't have a built in power source but they also don't need to be charged.

I should add having a flash light, a candle with waterproof matches, a shovel big enough to dig yourself out if you get stuck, some cat litter (put under tires to add traction) and knowing how both how to get your car unstuck (rocking, keeping wheel straight, etc) and how to disable traction control are all good things too.

Also always have your warmest winter outer wear including ski pants, etc in your car even if you don't wear them while you are driving. If you go camping and have a thermal sleeping bag put it in the car too. If you don't have this stuff don't worry about it as it is ""just in case"" stuff but if you do it is far better use in your back seat/trunk than sitting in your basement at home.

I see on another reply you say you are coming back to see your kids. A suggestion there is to have small token gifts for them like a cheaper toy, some candy, etc. Depending on the age they may be upset a little that you were gone and having something like that will quickly win them back to your side.

Edit: Your vehicle will be fine on the roads. Reality is keeping the major highways open in winter is a priority. The different an ""off road"" vehicle would give you in winter driving is basically in conditions you shouldn't be on the road to begin with and even then the added ""confidence"" it gives drivers usually exceeds the vehicle capabilities."

zaq8ii,iynnis3,CoryBoehm,2022-12-02 19:11:19,1,"As I noted in my reply I considered the HWY 16 turn off at Portage and through Neepawa. The reality of that route is you spend more time on a two lane highway v a 4 lane highway if you go via Brandon.  Also if for some reason you get stranded part way along the route there are better services, etc in Brandon than Neepawa.  


Also my most recent experience on HWY 16 was driving back to Winnipeg as the sun was setting and then set with wind blowing snow around. It wasn't making the road surface dangerous but it was making it more difficult to see and with two lanes on the highway and a significant amount of commercial truck traffic coming the opposite way it was definitely a higher stress drive. 

Compare that v Brandon to Portage on HWY 1 where it is four lanes of divided highway. There is more distance between you and the opposite direction flow. Also you can move to the right lane and easily go slower than the posted speed without triggering other drivers in quite the same way you would on HWY 16."

I was ready with my strengths and weaknesses, and that never came up. They asked me a couple of case study questions (what would you do if you had a client waiting and you were finishing up a session with another person, and at the last minute they made a comment about suicide?) They also asked if I believed therapy works and how I know (or something along those lines) and I think I ended up self disclosing too much about how therapy has changed my life and that's how I know. 
For my second interview I had all this in mind and was honest but didn't disclose too much. ""I've never worked in a clinical setting, but here are some approaches I'm interested in and why, and here are some trainings I have had."" ""I have seen first-hand how impactful therapy can be for people, and find just being with people and hearing what they have to say, witnessing their pain, to be exactly what they need in a time of distress.""

I'd say lessen your units as much as you can to give way for practicum as HTEs now require more onsite work setups so it might be difficult for you to render the hours required by the department. Some of us are going to commute to and from the office. Also, ACCCOB2 was the most difficult ACCCOB subject for me and DSIMGTS is a heavy subject with a lot of computations. They both have departmental exams with extensive coverage. COBECON and MADFUND would most probably have lighter workloads than the previous subjects.

If you prefer following the units prescribed in your flowchart, just make sure that your HTE requires a work-from-home setup so you'll have more time to study for other COB subjects. Lmk if you have other IS LIACOM questions! We can probably take some COB subjects together. See you around!"

10d7915,j4p5yyk,katlee9408,2023-01-17 07:34:02,1,"Thank you!!! I so appreciate the congratulations. And so hopeful things will click more easily shortly. 
These questions are RAD and I will ask em. 
On the counselor/client role play, can I ask how intricate the scenarios got? I have practice with OARS and a few basic interventions but still very much getting my feet wet."
10d7915,j4p62ax,katlee9408,2023-01-17 07:35:13,1,awesome awesome awesome- thanks truly. Great questions.
10d7915,j4p6n2c,beebutterflybreeze,2023-01-17 07:42:23,2,"if any role play situations come up, they’ll most likely be initial treatment phase so really it’s just listening, rapport building, being present, empathizing, affirming… probably you’re not going to have to demonstrate anything mid-treatment, where interventions might be useful/necessary. roleplays will most like be for the purpose of assessing your comfort level, ease, ability to think, ability to use supervision (when you’re debriefing after the role play). no one is expecting you to be a pro therapist out of the gates! they’re most interested in assessing your capacity, interest, confidence."
10d7915,j4pa5fn,katlee9408,2023-01-17 08:27:34,2,So comforting to hear— thank you so much for the ideas and the support.

I reached out to school counselors in my area via email to see if they were interested in having an intern. My school also provided a list, but it was on us to secure a site. Good luck!"
102ty4c,j3rojbw,kickcarriehard,2023-01-10 16:48:54,2,"It all depends on your state/university, but at my university I was not allowed to do my practicum/internship at the school I was employed at. I had to quit and find a part time night job."
102ty4c,j4jus5b,EquusFirth,2023-01-16 05:30:39,2,"This is likely going to depend on how much your university program is going to allow you to stretch the idea of a ""site supervisor"". For instance, paid supervision is a thing in the counseling world. When going for the SB-RPT credential, I hired someone to serve as my play therapy supervisor because no one at my school was one. It is possible your program might be willing to engage in this kind of arrangement, but I can't say."

102ty4c,j2yiixw,bolognaandcheeseplz,2023-01-04 20:58:08,1,Do they have a social worker or licensed therapist?
102ty4c,j30f3pf,jaymich17,2023-01-05 04:48:10,1,"For my program, you have to be supervised directly by a licensed school counselor with two years experience in the field. Not a school social worker, school psychologist etc. Has to be a school counselor. 

If you’re not sure about your program’s specific requirements, reach out to the program director/advisor so they can clarify for you. I ended up finding my practicum by researching local schools in my neighborhood and contacting their school counselors directly to see if they needed an intern."

10enzsy,j4sj36d,_heidster,2023-01-17 23:23:05,7,"Are they expecting you to carry a full caseload? Are you going to be treated as a free workhorse or a trainee? 

What is their supervision structure, how often, what’s their credentials, what’s their preferred modality? 

Do they hire interns after their practicum if both parties believe it is a good fit?

What is the overall culture. Will you have other therapists or support staff to go to with questions or will you be pushed in the deep end and expected to swim?"
10enzsy,j4taob2,ComprehensiveOwl9727,2023-01-18 02:35:40,1,I would always ask what kind of training they offer? Will they drop you in the deep end or will they give you some sort of structured training and onboarding experience. If there isn’t any formal training it means they are likely not investing in their employees either.
10enzsy,j4v2j0x,EcstaticArm2469,2023-01-18 13:44:46,1,"If you are able to interview with the person who would be supervising you, that would be ideal. Good Supervision is probably the most important thing; making sure you have someone who you jive with and feel comfortable being vulnerable with since this is such a vulnerable part of our lives! I am in a placement right now where I am technically getting really good experience, I have access to my supervisor all day because we share an office, I see my own patients with her supervising 20 minutes or so of each visit, I get to ask her questions all day, and the clinic I work in is wonderful. BUT, she can be a very difficult person to get along with, she can be very condescending, she takes advantage of my unpaid labor and eagerness to learn, and I don't always feel super safe being vulnerable with her. It has added a lot of stress to my life, and my days depend on if she's in a good mood or not.
No matter where you end up, it is what it is and part of the experience is being flexible and finding learning opportunities where you can. For me this year it is all about my own personal boundaries. Good luck!"
z1hloo,ixb592s,motherofmiltanks,2022-11-22 03:00:07,32,"Maybe you need to change school environments. Montessori and Reggio schools stress independence, and encourage teachers to do basically as you’re currently doing— letting the children explore, play, work, and make mistakes. As long as they’re not hurting themselves, another child, or any of the classroom materials, we let them do as they will (largely)."
z1hloo,ixbdoqw,buzzywuzzy75,2022-11-22 04:10:37,9,"Don't despair. My practicum teacher said the same thing about me. Montessori is a perfect fit for me, and it sounds like it would be for you, too."
z1hloo,ixb5tai,shesaidIcoulddoit,2022-11-22 03:04:36,8,"Without more information, it is very difficult to give you an answer. Most of what you’re feeling could be chalked up to imposter syndrome, something even seasoned teachers experience. HOWEVER…you said you’ve wanted to change for about two years. That’s a little too long to be imposter syndrome. Don’t finish out the degree JUST to finish it out. Better to switch now. 

Regardless, your internal feelings have more weight than the opinion of your practicum teacher. This may just be a difference of teaching style. Both styles can work, and both have merit. They will ultimately have the say as to whether or not you will pass your course. Do you have a course counselor you can speak to?

Edit: Holy autocorrect, Batman! Fixed my message to hopefully make a bit more sense. Also, as far as this teacher having a say in your grade, I misunderstood and thought you were talking about your student-teaching semester. THAT teacher you are placed with WILL have the say of you passing or not."
z1hloo,ixc3ajs,Icussr,2022-11-22 09:15:46,5,"Honestly, you sound like the kind of person I want caring for my toddler. She sounds like a controlling person who I would never leave my son alone with."
z1hloo,ixcpcdr,slayingadah,2022-11-22 13:32:41,3,"There are many, *many* ways to be an effective teacher of the tiny humans.

On the other hand, if you've even been considering changing degrees, that is a bit of a bright colored flag I'd look at, because the job is hard. Like, super hard, even for those of us who are fully in love w babies."
z1hloo,ixd39j3,agbellamae,2022-11-22 15:20:02,4,"I was told something similar by my mentor teacher during student teaching. When I got my own classroom the next year, it was fine. My issue really was being under that teacher’s guidance. Not all classrooms are alike and not all schools are alike. If you’re not a great fit in one, you may be perfect in another. I wouldn’t give up because of this one person."
z1hloo,ixdkgau,Jigglypuffisabro,2022-11-22 17:16:21,3,"They aren’t being disruptive or hurting anyone? They’re following directions? Then what on earth is the problem that this teacher thinks you need to solve? Sorry, I know the question is more about your career path but I’m totally distracted by this toddler tyrant (I’ve known a few)"
z1hloo,ixbwnhk,rosyposy86,2022-11-22 07:42:28,3,"I think the first 3 years are the hardest to get through with teaching, or I found it after I completed my degree. I can see why it takes 2-3 years to become fully registered, or in New Zealand it does anyway. Studying the theory and writing assignments is one thing, but being on the floor and gaining the practical experience is another. How is her feedback constructive? It’s not! Don’t let her put you off! You might find a centre that you enjoy with a supportive team. That takes some time too. My advice is to ignore her and do what you need too to pass. That boundary voice is going to come at some point. We all start somewhere."
z1hloo,ixe1sxd,Chasman1965,2022-11-22 19:08:27,3,"Just my general observation, if the kids are not being disruptive, not hurting anyone and are following directions, what else can you ask for?  As a parent, that is what I would want in a daycare.  Somebody that can manage the kids without ordering them around.  I think you just need a different daycare."
z1hloo,ixfbbn3,cookiegrab,2022-11-23 00:28:46,3,"This type of work takes experience, you have plenty of time to learn and grow. Every one of us was once where you are. If this is what you want to do you should absolutely do it.

Also big groups are not necessary. You don't have to work in a classroom in this field. Nannies in my city make a lot of money. There's also early intervention, working in administration, leading programs where children are accompanied by a guardian. I've now seen virtual ECE jobs. Depending on where you live there may be many other paths as well. There is a huge demand in this field and there are lots of kinds of jobs for many types of people.

Your style sounds a lot like mine and I prefer reggio inspired or a project approach. What you're describing could just be a mismatch in styles. Maybe look into doing observations at a program that uses a style closer to your own."
z1hloo,ixbam9l,PersonalityBeWild,2022-11-22 03:44:00,2,"I have the same approach as you it seems and I’ve never had any issues at any of my practicums. I’ve been told I’m really good with the children. I think you and the other educator may just have a personality clash. 

If you want to switch majors, switch, but if not, I’d just recommend a better classroom environment. Maybe you could be a 1 on 1 or do a younger age group for a smaller ratio?"
z1hloo,ixcvjtu,Long_Island_Native,2022-11-22 14:23:27,2,Letting the kids do what they want so long as they aren’t hurting anyone or anything bad is a good thing. That alone doesn’t make it sound to me that you’re Not cut out for this field.
z1hloo,ixejh92,Suitable_Evidence_80,2022-11-22 21:04:54,2,"It’s one person’s opinion - if you have invested time and money in your current program it makes sense to finish so you have something to show for your hard work and then re-evaluate. You may find another practicum is a completely different experience. 
I am a student too and have heard from college teachers that they even had the worst first field placement experiences but found their footing in subsequent placements.
Good luck either way"
z1hloo,ixfjkht,ActCompetitive,2022-11-23 01:35:19,2,"Have you thought about Early Intervention? Those jobs are often called ""developmental therapist"" where I'm from, and usually involve going into homes or daycares to work with one child at a time. I've also seen clinics like Easter Seals that have small toddler developmental therapy groups, where the emphasis is on teaching skills vs. behavior management."
z1hloo,ixczyxm,thin_white_dutchess,2022-11-22 14:56:19,1,"Meh, only you know if you’d enjoy what you are doing. The rest can come. I learn something new everyday. There are many different environments and you can find one that fits your style. There will always be someone with something negative to say. It’s up to you to decide if what they said has any merit. When some has critique for me- on any topic- I sit with it, take anything that has merit, make notes, and throw away the rest. I’m always happy for constructive feedback, even if presented negatively, bc personally, I can throw away the negativity and not let it bother me, so I make it all constructive. 
But if you are doubting your career choice, sit with that doubt and list it out. Why do you enjoy it? What are you good at? What are you reservations? What else would you be interested in? No shame in switching if you want."

z1hloo,ixey1ie,Canatriot,2022-11-22 22:46:54,1,"I’m going through something similar and I think we may have similar pedagogical philosophies.  My college practicum instructor thinks my growth this semester has been limited by my aversion to controlled, teacher-directed, mandatory group activities.  Note that I do many activities with children, but they are nearly always child-led and in voluntary small groups or one-to-one.  I’m chalking it up to a difference in philosophies and trying not to let it bother me.  Luckily for me, I am the director at my centre and we are Reggio inspired.  It’s literally in our family orientations that we don’t force circle times, etc."
z1hloo,ixcnrlk,pussyforpresident,2022-11-22 13:18:34,7,"Seconding this! As a Montessori guide you sound like a perfect fit. It’s less about classroom management and more about classroom guidance, only intervening for disruption, danger, destructiveness, over frustration. Letting the children manage their own environment and guiding them how to do it — it’s very rewarding!"
z1hloo,ixe6pq7,None,2022-11-22 19:40:45,3,"Yeah, I think a Montessori might be a better fit for me. I don't know much about them though so I've never thought about going to one."

z1hloo,ixbfmof,None,2022-11-22 04:28:31,3,"I don't really think the daycare teacher really has a say in whether or not I pass my course since I'm still in college. It's not like I'm specifically only there for my practicum, I'm doing it through my class at school. So I feel like as long as the professor knows that I've been going there, I should be able to pass. I could try talking to my advisor at my college to see what I should do."

zmvnrr,j0f8xqe,Usual_Vegetable_9034,2022-12-16 05:07:57,1,"The mentor would only be in the classroom to observe me and occasionally intervene, after a while they would start leaving you alone in the classroom.

zmvnrr,j0fansm,ElvenDreadWolf,2022-12-16 05:25:02,6,Your mentor teacher shouldn't be dipping out. They're still legally responsible for that class. They should still be assisting you and working with you in regards to planning and should easily be able to take back their class. That's wild to me.

ytaw2x,iw32f1a,MediocreKim,2022-11-12 16:08:38,63,Talk to your practicum supervisor again. These are extenuating circumstances.
ytaw2x,iw32hz4,footwith4toes,2022-11-12 16:09:15,67,You’ve been in there 2 days and your AT said they might fail you? Regardless of dealing with your grief your AT is awful.
ytaw2x,iw38kys,PM_ME_UR_JUICEBOXES,2022-11-12 16:52:04,21,"I am very sorry for your loss and for the added stress that your mentor teacher is creating for you.

I can relate to your situation. When I was doing my practicum placement, I found out that my father was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer and that my grandmother died. I took a day off to grieve and my mentor teacher lectured me about how I needed to be more committed and then told me a story about how when she was performing a lead role in a theatrical production, her father died and she still managed to get through it and never took a day off. 

Some people have zero sympathy for others because they are so fucked up themselves. She told me her story of pushing down her feelings with such pride, while I thought she sounded deranged for not allowing herself ONE DAY OFF to grieve her FATHER’s death. 

Looking back, I wish I had stood up for myself more. I suggest that you email your mentor teacher and clearly state that you have recently suffered the loss of a parent. Tell them that it is unrealistic for the Faculty of Education to expect for you to be unaffected by your parent’s death but that you are doing your best to meet the expectations of your placement. Ask your mentor for specific feedback of what they would like you to improve on in order to earn a passing grade from them - and make sure this communication is in writing and CC your practicum fascilitator. 

Don’t be snarky and don’t overexplain yourself. Just state the simple facts and get clarity so that you can get through this and never have to work with your mentor teacher again."
ytaw2x,iw354zo,No_Concert2051,2022-11-12 16:28:18,11,"From my own experience, failing a practicum was super rare and it only happened to one person in my program. It was because he was late a lot or didn’t show up and just generally did not do the work. Like you had to be actively incompetent to fail. 

Does your AT know that your dad passed away? I still think they are being unreasonable if you’re only two days in but not extending any grace or compassion is messed up. Also “threatening” to fail you is awful when we are in desperate need of teachers right now and even more so of capable people who actually want to be teachers. It seems like your facilitator wants to push you to stay there so if you have to I would ask what expectations the AT has and how you can actively meet them. If things don’t get better next week though I would push hard for a switch. Have you thought about taking a break from school for now? I’m not sure how that would work but it might be beneficial for you with what you’re going through.

I hope things get better for you ❤️"
ytaw2x,iw3xux7,Ok-Butterscotch1282,2022-11-12 19:47:56,7,"Im sorry to hear you are going through this. I mentor student teachers and I think empathy is an important concept to model, especially in our professions. I have failed students in the past, it is luck of the draw for us too. I have had student teachers not show up on time, not hand in any lesson plans, nor were prepared to teach during agreed periods (chosen weeks ahead of time). Literally warm bodies in my room who then blamed me for not teaching them how to write up a lesson plan. I’m very transparent, open, and understanding with my communication and mentoring. I know my responsibilities. So when things get turned on me when literally zero work is being done after weeks of placement, that’s a fail to me. I actually am going to stop being a mentor due to this happening to me twice now. I’ve been doing this for years but the last 2 have really turned me off from continuing. 

Two days into placement is way too early to know whether anyone is going to fail and I hope things get better for you! My advice is to get your advisor involved and maybe have a meeting with all 3 of you to sort through these differing viewpoints? Have the handbook ready to go through responsibilities on both sides and explain how you have kept up with yours. It’s nice to have a middle person to help navigate these conversations."
ytaw2x,iw33fcm,3railbank,2022-11-12 16:16:01,5,"The AT should be more transparent about the reason. I’m pretty sure there are a number of categories/aspects they evaluate you on. Do you have a copy of the evaluation document? I haven’t looked at mine in 10 years, so I don’t remember. What specifically in that document do they not see you succeeding in?"
ytaw2x,iw3bpgp,Stock_Ad8624,2022-11-12 17:13:41,6,Some ATs can be a bitch. i think you should just sit with her or him and communicate. Be straight forward. say look I’m going through a rough time. Tell them what can i do to succeed.
ytaw2x,iw3f5t8,Efu1,2022-11-12 17:37:24,6,"Wow, 2 days and your MT said that? Did you do anything or refused to something they asked of you? This is ridiculous regardless. You might want to talk to your Facilitator before is too late."
ytaw2x,iw3vh1u,lemonish_,2022-11-12 19:31:21,5,"But three days ago you posted and made it seem like you had been there longer and the kids liked you, now you said it’s only been two days and you’re just observing? Can you be more explicit with what you have been doing and for how long so we can give better advice?"
ytaw2x,iw32sj7,FoundSweetness,2022-11-12 16:11:23,11,"Push to change again. Talk to mentor teacher and tell them you don’t see a fit where you are, you asked to change but they are not receptive. If they see it too, they can push for a change as well.  Of course - do this diplomatically.  I would highlight that this is your career - and a failed practicum is not a option."
ytaw2x,iw3rdp2,GargoyleLyra,2022-11-12 19:01:55,8,I have failed a placement before and it did feel terrible. But the teacher I had was a pretty bad teacher and embarrassed me in front of the students and scolded me in front of the students. Don't be like me and just let it go. You need to let these people know that you are struggling. And if need be go all the way to the Dean. Do not let these people push you around!
ytaw2x,iw395s8,DramaticPride4527,2022-11-12 16:56:00,3,"I’ve had a situation where I didn’t get along with my AT, but unfortunately due to a lack of placements I feel like it’s unlikely they will change it for you. If it’s only been two days, and you haven’t even taught yet, your AT has no basis to say she thinks you will fail. You should have some kind of form or handbook that outlines expectations. Even though it’s tough, I suggest that you ask your AT to sit down with you and to clearly outline her expectations, and go over the ones from school. Ask her which ones she’s concerned about. 

Your practicum coordinator is also supposed to be there to support you, but in any workplace you NEED to advocate for yourself.  No one else will. Email your coordinator and inform them of this situation. Don’t ask to switch, just be straightforward with what’s going on and what your AT said. Let them know you have asked her for a meeting, so it shows you are taking initiative but your coordinator is aware what’s going on if they need to step in. 

Also I’m not sure what school you go to but you may be able to go to accessibility services. I was registered with them and my accessibility advisor helped me a lot when I needed it during practicum since she advocated for me"
ytaw2x,iw3iai0,gillsaurus,2022-11-12 17:58:41,3,Honestly speak to the school’s admin if your practicum facilitator isn’t being helpful or supportive. Tell them admin your situation and if there’s a way you can be switched to another teacher?
ytaw2x,iw3kxk4,einekleineZiege,2022-11-12 18:16:53,3,"Has she actually explained her expectations of you? If not, definitely ask her what they are, because she shouldn’t be failing you on a list of outcomes she never even made you aware of. 

Also I’m pretty sure the “expectations” come on a form from your program, and if you are doing those things, she shouldn’t be able to fail you."
ytaw2x,iw5gias,Hoggster86,2022-11-13 02:38:39,3,"To be honest, I had to fail my student teacher once. It was only because they were always late (like 25 min after the bell everyday so I had to start the class, never had anything prepared and just put up my lessons and gave my tests and gave students their Snapchat). 

They are not in teaching now and never actually finished the degree."
ytaw2x,iw3eguv,wizard20007,2022-11-12 17:32:42,2,"I’m sorry to hear you’re dealing with this. I lost both parents not long before teachers college started, it’s one of the worst things you can deal with. If you feel you need a break then advocate for yourself. These things happen, and come back when you feel emotionally prepared. 

The problem with practicum is you’re really getting luck of the draw with your AT as they differ vastly with their expectations. Have you outwardly specified that your father has passed away? I know this can be hard, but transparency is important for this scenario. I wish you luck on your path to becoming a teacher as it is a unique one for everyone!"
ytaw2x,iw3zfc0,Odd_Light_8188,2022-11-12 19:58:46,2,Speak to your faculty advisor asap.
ytaw2x,iw4i5k4,TroLLageK,2022-11-12 22:11:12,2,"Your first lesson to that class: 
How to be empathetic human beings. 

Hopefully your AT learns a thing or two. 

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Thankfully even if you do need to redo it, it's not the ideal situation but it's doable. You should be able to speak to your program faculty and ask for help, perhaps instead you can make it up doing extra work or something later on."
ytaw2x,iw4tay3,Wendythewondercat,2022-11-12 23:34:39,2,Go to the university counselling and wellness people and ask for help advocating. You should end this practicum and get a new placement. This being said by a many times mentor teacher. Could be they just have no one else who could take you
ytaw2x,iw4ucey,Wendythewondercat,2022-11-12 23:42:30,2,"Wanted to also say ask your practicum supervisor to come out more often to supervise you and oversee. A second set of eyes may help you and ascertain whether your host teacher is being reasonable and fair or not.

Be sure to ask in advance from the host teacher what their expectations are. Have all your lessons ready in advance and done/prepped perfectly and submitted well on time. Do all the prep/photocopying etc and have all rubrics and assessment/evaluation and differentiation materials also prepped at the outset. Be sure to show your understanding of diagnostic, formative, and summative assessment. Be sure to know and be ready to articulate what your learning goals and success criteria are every day. And be sure to know which students have IEPs and follow the prescribed accommodations and modifications.

A permanent teacher only gets 5 days after an immediate family member’s passing and is expected to return to work and continue as usual. Harsh but there it is…otherwise they apply for a leave of absence. Bear in mind your mentor teacher might be just trying to treat you as she would a colleague and you do be expected to move one after the week off. 

I’m so sorry for your loss. I wish you all the best as I’m sure this isn’t easy at all"
ytaw2x,iw4wgij,The_Fallout_Kid,2022-11-12 23:58:35,2,"After 2 days!? Ludicrous. The first 3 days should be observation - how can you be on a pathway way to failure during your observation period?????? This person does not sound like a sound associate teacher. Signed, an associate teacher lol."
ytaw2x,iw5edzr,Zelldandy,2022-11-13 02:21:24,2,"In contrast, I learnt my dad and grandma were terminally ill, my cat suddenly died, and I got COVID in the span of 2.5 weeks. My AT's only comment was that I make sure to explicitly communicate in my email that I regret the inconvenience a sudden absence caused. (Normally I would do this, but I was sleep deprived and frantic at 2:30am trying to get my cat to the vet 5h before practicum start.) She reduced my responsibilities in the meantime out of compassion. Your AT is being unreasonable. Even a good principal would understand. ""Pushing through"" is not in alignment with current narratives on mental health and self-care, so don't be fooled."
ytaw2x,iw7indb,primavoce72,2022-11-13 15:47:28,2,"As an associate teacher of 17, (soon to be 18), student teachers your mentor teacher is an ass. How if she’s never seen you teach is she able to make that call? I would ask her to give you examples of how you are not meeting her standard. I would ask her to give you concrete methods for improvement. Make her put her money where her mouth is. I would also ask for a new AT.  My advice is to document in writing everything she says to you. Every piece of feed back, what it pertains to and how it was delivered. She is being unfair to you. 

I tried to fail a student teacher because she dropped obscenities repeatedly in my classroom, treated my students like dogs, (she had been a former dog trainer and thought that teaching and training would be quite similar) stole things from me, and didn’t notice when 28 kids got up and left and a new class came in a sat down. She was highly inept and totally ineffective as a teacher. She graduated from her faculty of education, as they refused to throw her out, but didn’t ever, that I know of, work in the field. I do know that she received ineffective evaluations from her last placement as well, which means that she didn’t have a single effective evaluation to provide to school boards when applying.  

In the event that she gives you an unsuccessful evaluation; you will have a hard time getting hired with a bad evaluation, but I just wouldn’t include it in any hiring packages and simply say when applying to positions going forward that you didn’t complete it because your father passed and I might even go as far as providing a copy of his death certificate with your hiring package. This explains why you don’t have it and gives proof it isn’t because it was unsuccessful. At the very least get in touch with your faculty advisor immediately and let them know what’s happening. Your AT’s behaviour is totally unwarranted. 

I’m sorry you are dealing with this and my deepest condolences at the loss of your father. I’m not sure where you are located or what university you are studying with but I would be willing to take you on if you are close to me, pm me if you need help or guidance."

Although, a redo can’t be the end of the world. Tack the days on at the end. I’m sure there is a contingency plan for stuff like this through your uni."

ytaw2x,iw3x2qo,brahdyz09,2022-11-12 19:42:37,2,"Hi, I posted that post on my first day of placement (November 8). I was supposed to start placement November 7 but because that was an asynch day due to the strike I started on November 8. I was feeling overwhelmed on my first day due to her high expectations so I made that post. I had a discussion with my mentor teacher at the end of the day on November 9 (my last day of placement for that week) which was when they mentioned that I may fail so at that point it had only been two days. I said the students were great because they are! In the first day I was there they made me feel welcome and are so well behaved and I had a couple of periods where I was left alone with them so I was observing and supervising them. I haven’t taught a formal lesson yet, I’m set to do that this week. For the rest of the week I had been in conversation with my practicum facilitator about what to do moving forward after my MTs comments and they just told me to push it through. I posted this post today as I’m feeling very anxious about going back on Monday and advice on what to do to avoid failing."

ytaw2x,iw5d44u,Admirral,2022-11-13 02:11:12,1,more than likely your AT is one of those miserable people who no-life's the job. Their students likely hate them too.

If that's true, that's a HUGE red flag. A student teacher is not an employee of the board. They can't be left alone with students. That's an enormous liability issue."

ytaw2x,iw4bdpu,Ebillydog,2022-11-12 21:21:55,3,"You need to have a conversation with your faculty advisor and let them know exactly what has been going on. Both that your MT talked about failing you on the second day, and that she left you alone with the students for an extended period of time. The first created a hostile learning environment for you, and the second was a huge no no. Under no circumstance should you be alone in a room with the class, because if something happens your career could be over before it starts  - you are not protected by the union or insurance or anyone. Do not blame yourself for doing something wrong. When you're grieving, it's easy to be hard on yourself, but the mentor teacher is the one who is supposed to be in charge and guiding you. This is on her.

Most mentor teachers, and teachers in general, are kind, generous individuals who are supportive and helpful. Unfortunately, there are a small number who really shouldn't be in a classroom or mentoring others. If this is the case, your faculty advisor needs to know ASAP, and they need to find you a different mentor teacher for this practicum, or at least have a serious conversation with this one. You are paying lots of money for the program, and delaying your practicum will have real consequences for you as it will delay your ability to start working as a teacher."
ytaw2x,iw48diq,brahdyz09,2022-11-12 21:00:35,5,Ya it’s not fair at all. I’m gonna give her another week to just give her the benefit of the doubt and maybe she was having a bad week. If this week goes badly I’m gonna be demanding to be switched. I’m simply going through too much and spending too much money to be treated so badly.

ytaw2x,iw4axih,davergaver,2022-11-12 21:18:43,3,To be honest be mindful of how much time you have ahead of you. I had a 2 week eval which was great. I also was suppose to have a mid and final eval. I just knew just like you did that my mid was going to be bad and it was not my fault. So people are jealous or for whatever reason. I had this feeling that my AT was conspiring or had this all calculated so that I would fail my eval. I presented a solid  case to my school and to demand . They pulled me out and put me at another school. It was easier to fix since I left earlier. Are you elementary or secondary?
ytaw2x,iw6cdid,Hot-Inspector-2937,2022-11-13 08:01:42,1,Call her out for discrimination or racist see how she reacts then switch. No other reason to fail you and you only been there 2 days bruh

ytaw2x,iw4bbse,brahdyz09,2022-11-12 21:21:32,-1,"I am elementary, and I think that’s part of the reason why my practicum facilitator doesn’t want to switch me. I don’t have much time left in this placement (20 days to be exact) and that’s why they’re urging me to just push through. I only have one eval near the end of December so I’m not sure what to do. I’ll see how this week goes I guess."
ytaw2x,iw4v48y,Wendythewondercat,2022-11-12 23:48:20,5,The pro no ‘em is you have to submit your evaluations when you apply for jobs. Don’t stick it out if it’s bad. Be 100% on point and if it doesn’t go this week be insistent
ytaw2x,iwg33fg,ScaryRasin,2022-11-15 11:19:29,1,"You are assuming this individual wants to be a teacher after they graduate- a lot of candidates are not choosing that path due to things like this, along with the general state of our schools today. Not saying a bad eval is ideal but also don’t want OP to spiral if this AT nails them on their eval"
ytaw2x,iwg6nun,Wendythewondercat,2022-11-15 12:03:17,2,"True, I am making that assumption. But I’m a school principal and have been an associate teacher over a dozen times, and am on an admissions committee for a popular faculty of education, and I’ve never met a student who didn’t want to, or at least heavily lean towards wanting a career as a teacher. Particularly those who did the consecutive program vs concurrent. (It’s vastly different how things work in Canada vs US, so also assuming you’re Canadian here.)  In Ontario, where I am, a bad evaluation can seriously, seriously hamper your ability to find work and to get a contract quickly. Spiralling is obviously not good; and it would be better though to miss a practicum and avail yourself of the Wellness supports of the university, or double down n refusing the placement if the AT isn’t being reasonable or understanding. A 6 month delay in graduation to redo a placement is far preferable than a year or more delay in securing employment and delaying pension eligibility later in life. Honestly though, education is so hard and challenging right now I wouldn’t recommend it as a career to a lot of people, and maybe this is not the right avenue for OP. Presumably they’re young enough to change fields and go for something a little less of an emotionally hard job."

I would also have a conversation about expectations as far as caseload and number of hours expected to be worked. My site supervisor is awesome so I was able to work remotely or in the office when necessary, but you definitely want to get some clearly defined roles and expectations before you agree to do it."

You cannot both administer emergency care and go get help. As an experienced clinician I chance it, but I am also a registered nurse with 10 years of experience responding to code blue alarms…but I also purposely have an office next door to a business whose hours are longer than mine (it’s a bakery, at least 3 people are there from 4 am until 11 pm seven days a week) and I keep a good relationship with them."
y9qnl5,it6ysrw,DoctorSweetheart,2022-10-21 11:49:24,6,"While some practices have moved to electronic,  not everyone has and there's nothing bad or wrong with paper charting.

Personally,  I think paper charting is much more secure. It stays in a locked file cabinet in a locked room. Electronic charts can be accessed from anywhere and the practice had to depend on each individual to keep them secure."

Thos is a question for your DCT.

>The director of the site wanted me to start away and didn't do an interview.

Maybe weird, maybe not. If it's a master's level first prac, it's not really expected to have any clinical experience or skills.

>Their site was super old looking like 70s wallpaper and box VCR TV. Everything is being done with paper and no technology. Like paper billing, paper progress notes, etc.

Nothing wrong with this. Especially with a large cohort if students, this can help with security. 

>Also no one has their own office and there are just therapy rooms that is first come, first serve it seems like, is that normal?

Yes, of course. This is typical in lots of organizations. Even in large institutions.  

>The part that got me was that as an intern I would get a pair of keys to the building when I need to do my shifts if no one is already there. I wouldn't mind but the office is in a questionable area and she said there will be one day of my schedule where I will be the only person there. Is that normal? Should I be concern?

This was the case at a nonprofit where I worked. I was very often the only person there."

Things that I saw others go through, when we were in practicum, that didn’t feel good to me were people being asked to see clients one on one as soon as they started, even being given a whole caseload.  Supervisors not immediately available, not shadowing client work, not working through the experiences with the students. It’s the lack of support and guidance that would be a red flag for me. 

AND….the caveat is that although those things made me uncomfortable to see happening, and were very uncomfortable for the students living through them, we all learned from it. One of my professors told me not to worry about good placement/bad placement, because you’ll learn what you think is bad practice, unethical, what you don’t want to be or do in a “bad” placement. And that’s a very valuable practicum experience."

There isn't a large amount of students. The organization has two sites and I will be located at the 2nd site with 4 other people. They are associates and other students.

When I told my personal therapist about this she said that it's odd they haven't moved everything onto electronics. She made me questioned if I will get proper training as a trainee since everything is done electronic now.

I wasn't sure how I felt being alone in sketchy area of the neighborhood. When I brought this up to her she just brushed it off like I was being whiny and ridiculous. I was born and raise in the that area so I know the crime pretty well. The director is from the next town over. There's kind of nothing to make me feel safe and I will be working til 8pm.

I think it’s important to trust your gut with safety concerns. It’s okay to ask what sort of security/ protection is provided around the building. For example is there a security camera outside the building and parking lot? Are there emergency buttons in each session room? Maybe it sounds alarmist but I feel it’s important to not discredit your own physical and emotional safety, especially early in the career.

Many school programs require a licensed person to be on site because the point of an internship is to learn and make mistakes.  Its not about thinking your students aren't competent or need babysitting.   The interns I supervise are very intelligent and good counselors, but they have a million questions.  Calling isn't always sufficient.   I've had plenty of situations where I needed guidance asap and my supervisor didn't pick up right away.  Im glad youve been lucky in your experience never to have had a situation where 2 people were needed.  When I was doing anger management groups,  we had a man arrive intoxicated.  The clinician present took him out of group, sat with him in another room and helped him call someone to get him while I ran the rest of the group.

y9qnl5,it7ekiw,ProfessionalEcho001,2022-10-21 14:01:11,6,Thanks! You have eased a lot of my anxiety. I told this situation to my personal therapist and the plan was to stay and check it out and then switch placements if I have to. But I feel like that is such a huge hassle..

I don’t think we should normalize practicum sites taking advantage of masters level students and not providing proper oversight and protections. It’s bad for our profession and could contribute to burnout (or worse) for students.

Never mind the clients’ experiences in all this"

I personally don’t think the site or the sup is worth OP’s time. The signs seem to indicate the potential for serious repercussions. If it was something like “I need more onboarding” or “where can I find these forms,” I’d say have a discussion about processes.

Stuff with money, keys, and working at the facility alone screams bad time."

Also a large part of why I will not move in to supervision, as it’s not my instinct to strategize my answers; I’m an extrovert. I say what I feel and I feel out loud. It’s a whole thing. 😅

In my area, when I was in practicum, there were very few sites offering supervision and practicum, and very little support from the school in getting sites. We had to scout, contact and negotiate placement ourselves, and have it approved. So when I read that someone is feeling anxiety about practicum, those facts come up for me. I do not assume that it would be an easy thing to just find a better, more supportive environment…if it was, I assume they wouldn’t ask about how to manage it. So I shift my focus to supporting them through whatever they feel capable of doing…because all therapists, all situations, are different."

I forgot what it’s like to not have those resources while in training. I still feel raw about how students (and licensed candidates/associates/interns) get treated.

It should (imo) be incumbent on the training program system (school to site) to provide adequate resources. It’s unfortunate that students have to deal with systemic issues (at their own relative professional peril) when just getting started.

Thanks for engaging in the discussion with me :)"

yodhdd,ivekoxx,SivaDaDestroyer,2022-11-07 12:05:54,3,I see a religious or philosophical leader of some sort.  One who is challenged a lot and so ends up in a lot of debates and polemics.  How deep and authentic the brand of philosophy or spirituality they espouse is is open to question.  They may be good at telling people what they want to hear.
yodhdd,ivetvjz,pinkoo28,2022-11-07 13:32:18,3,"They have 5 planets in retrograde so they must have had a lot of internal struggle and I feel like they would have become successful later in life once they moved through all that inhibited them and came closer to their North node in Gemini. With their sun and Venus conjunct I feel like people see them as confident, maybe a TV news reporter or a podcaster.
 I think the most challenging part of this chart is Saturn conjunct Mars (both Rx) in the 8th house in Pisces. It's also opposite the sun and Venus conjunction. It all feels like a big struggle, I wonder if they lost a father figure.
 I'm still new to astrology so that's just what I felt, if I think of anything else I'll add to it later"
yodhdd,ivi28u2,potato_gato,2022-11-08 02:55:18,3,"The moon in the 10th in Virgo immediately makes me think this person is a public servant (someone who works perhaps as a politician). Sun and Venus in the third house in Cap makes me think they are very ambitious and have been  in their field of work for a long time, they hold their values close to them and communicate them easily (I also see Pluto in Leo, so I can see they are from the baby boomer generation).  That opposition to mars conjunct Saturn in the 8th house in Cancer makes me think that they struggle with lining up their values with their actions, almost like they often hesitate to act or they face a lot of opposition. The Scorpio ascendant gives this figure more of a private, subdued persona perhaps, despite being extroverted and out in the public."
yodhdd,ivr2bq2,2KatEyes,2022-11-09 23:55:08,3,"Very tight conjunction between mars/saturn cancer opposite venus/sun capricorn and forming a cardinal t-square with Jupiter libra at the apex (point). Often, t-squares which include sun and saturn, give us someone very ambitious and who feel they have something to prove. This would be particularly true here, given the capricorn/cancer influence.

>So we have an ambitious personality, perhaps one from modest background; yet quiet virgo moon at the mc would be thrust into the limelight, but basically a shy person. 

This person might make a living as a writer (virgo moon, 3rd H sun/venus).  Chart Ruler Pluto in the 9th generally supports this. Scorpio ascendant and Cap sun dive deep but with 1st/7th house empty, not really a people person.. someone who keeps more to themselves.. This is emphasized by the unaspected moon (orb is too wide for uranus square) conjunct mc. 

However the inconjunct between Uranus and Mercury give a slight eccentricity to the mind and thoughts of this person.

Perhaps known as a writer or could be healer of some sort (Mc conjunct virgo moon, cap/cancer emphasis)."
yodhdd,ivqe517,Redrodder,2022-11-09 21:09:45,2,Is it possible to see the degrees of the planets?
yodhdd,ivr4stx,thebookofleviathan,2022-11-10 00:13:31,2,"* This person is known as a servant to the public, someone who provides help through their services.  They communicate very effectively when it comes to their work,   They have a great capacity to heal and help others.  However, there is a great intensity, a hidden mystery to this person that many can’t see, but they do feel it. This may prove to be one of their greatest assets.   
*  The upbringing of this person was not traditional.   They are grateful for the small things because life often presents them with great challenges they must overcome, especially within the realms of their emotions and homelife.  The road to their public recognition was not quick and simple, and their greatest struggle may come in dealing with balancing their relationships and their dreams.  They face an intense inner struggle.  They feel things very deeply and they want to keep it that way, they won’t let it touch the surface.
* When it comes to their personality, they aren’t exactly an open book.  At least not on first impression, they take a while to warm up.  There’s a lot they aren’t going to show you.  If they decide you are worth the investment, they’ll be very committed to you.  They are very much about their business, and they work hard, although people may not see just how hard they go. They may find success in love and business later in life most likely.
* With many planets in retrograde, and the planets Saturn and Mars in detriment and fall respectively, there is a lot of challenge both internally and externally this person has gone through.  If they pursue balance within their lives and a consistent, healthy outlet for their emotions, I believe they can find much more relief for their past scars and current challenges."
yodhdd,ivzivah,gelinotte_II,2022-11-11 19:49:11,2,"Mercury rules the MC in 3rd by whole sign houses and has the Moon close to the MC applying to it. These all make me think this person is a writer or communicator. Mercury also is in applying aspect to the retro Mars-Saturn conjunction. More Mercury influence. 

Mars ruling the AC in Cancer with Saturn will make this person really unusual and perhaps even comical in their approach to life, but I would think they are  very tenacious. These being in the 9th whole sign house education, travel and religion should be important topics for the life path, possibly politics too. They might have extreme ideas or beliefs. Though from the examples I know with the same placements (Bryan Ferry, Diane Keaton) this is not that clear. It may be that with Cancer the stangest things are private, and only part of that spills over into what we see of the public person. Another Cancer-Capricorn theme is history and tradition, and their offspring, nostalgia. I think these will be a strong strain in the personality.

Venus square Jupiter is the tightest aspect in the chart. In Libra to Capricorn I see this as a refined aesthetic, and I think this would influence what the person is known for, particularly as the Sun rules the 10th whole sign house and is in aspect to both benefics."

What the native is known for?

There's quite an emphasis on 2nd/3rd, 8th, 10th and 11th houses in chart and an emphasis on Cardinal signs/energy -  with all those oppositions and squares. I feel that the oppositions/squares are too wide by degree to say it's a Cardinal t-square, but pretty close - a lot of tensions. Rulers of AC and Sun/Venus/Merc both being in retrograde and conjunct points to these energies not being expressed in a usual, 'accepted' or expected way to there is something a bit different and unique about them or their background. They are someone who deals with the public though and has success with that (Moon in 10th and Jupiter in 11th). Moon square Uranus supports them being a bit innovative, unusual or different as well - they may be known for bringing in reform or change to their field, perhaps controversially. 

I'm getting perhaps a teacher, university lecturer, academic, writer or someone in a prominent or important role in public service/bureaucracy managing a Health or Education system on a state/Federal/country wide level perhaps (2nd/8th house axis). But I'm usually way off on guessing this!

Jupiter in 11th in Libra square Sun and Venus - they are well liked/supported publicly I think. 

  
Native’s life story?

The tension in squares and oppositions between Sun/Venus, Mars/Saturn and Jupiter I think points to native having to overcome a fair bit in early life - whatever they have now and have achieved wasn't handed to them and they had to work hard for it .  If Sun or Saturn represents father in the chart, both are not particularly well placed and in the case of Sun - on the receiving end of oppositions from malefics strongly conjunct, in Rx and both in detriment/fall. I'm going to go out on a limb and say there were possibly issues with father or father figure  for native as a child - dad possibly not well off and struggled to provide for family, possibly absent, possibly passed early, this had a lasting impact on native (Saturn ruling Sun, Mercury and Venus in Cap.)

If we take Moon to represent mother - Moon is very well placed in angular house and conj MC - mother is extremely influential in natives life, what native is known for has been strongly influenced by mother, I would go as far to say that mother may have been in a 'better place' of privilege than father to be able to meet native's needs as a child, possibly mother was main provider which would have been a bit unusual for the time (pluto in leo generation.) Moon also ruling Cancer Mars/Saturn supports this I think. 

Native possibly came from a disadvantaged background and overcame odds and obstacles to achieve what they have.

  
Native’s personality traits?

I think native quite a reserved, serious and private person with Sun in Cap, Moon in Virgo and AC in Scorpio - but the 10th house Moon conjunct MC in Virgo and Jupiter in 11th shows that they have a level of public prominence and success - but being public or open about themselves is not especially their comfort zone. They are happy to be public about their work and what they are trying to achieve in career, but not so much about themselves and are not at all into celebrity or fame. Cap/Virgo/Scorpio points to steady determination and persistence towards achieving goals and ambitions and 'putting in the work' to get there.

  
The good / bad of the native's chart?

Good - Moon and Jupiter placements and aspects. Moon conj. MC. Neptune trine Venus/Sun. Jupiter in 11th as benefic as apex of wide t-square. 

Bad - Mars/Saturn placements and their oppositions and rulerships of AC/Sun/Venus/Merc.

  
Do you share any similar placements? How do those placements manifest for you?

I have Sun in Cap in 11th squaring (5 degree orb) Saturn in Libra with a Scorpio Moon conj Jupiter. I know a bit about having Cap/Scorpio placements! But that's really where similarities end. I definitely have 'father issues' as well and my mother was more of a 'provider' than my Dad was."
yodhdd,ivndr16,geophagustapajos,2022-11-09 05:32:42,1,"1 What the native is known for

Alrighty! Known for is 10th house/MC. Starting with the Leo 10th, the sun is in the 3th Capricorn conjunct Venus copresent Mercury. All of these are opposite the Mars/Saturn conjunction in Cancer 9th. Cancer is ruled by the moon in the 11th in Virgo on the MC. Virgo is ruled by Mercury and you can do the whole roundabout again. 

This is a public figure who is known for intellect, planning, thinking. Mars Saturn can be... War like, hawkish, and both are in fall/detriment and retrograde really brings out the worst in both. They are really at odds with the sun/Venus/Mercury and with Mars being the chart ruler this person may be very difficult or cause issues. 

With the sun, Venus, Mercury in third it feels like a very deliberating, reality oriented career. STEM feels like a real possibility, with the third/ninth, although writing or political or military related could be as well. Maybe even something financial or business related. 

The Jupiter square to the sun from the 12th really seems like this person benefited or felt at home being alone, or work needed to happen in isolation. I circle back to doctor/STEM here, but yeah it could still be politics (Libra)/military/writing, things done in secret. Perhaps lots of death, hopefully this guy isn't a murderer?? Or else a lot of hidden enemies!


 2 Native’s life story

Can I get some specificity on this? It's a very large topic!

 3 Native’s personality traits

With the Scorpio rising Mars rx + Saturn rx... This person has had hard knocks and probably is reflected in their personality. It's pretty cold, inability to express themselves fully. I believe introverted. Mars Saturn is pretty gas pedal and brake at the same time, and it seems like a lot of internal turmoil is possible. Capricorn/Virgo is already pretty practical and reality oriented. Brass tacks, bootstraps. Exacting, penetrating (Scorpio). Virgo moons get perfectionist, this person might be critical. I also think that money is probably important to them and they might be a penny pincher. 

 4 The good / bad of the native's chart

Good: moon on MC in the 11th. Angular strength to the luminary of sect in the good spirits house. This person had the ability to be in charge/leadership and probably got support from friends/community/public. 

Bad: that Saturn rx + Mars rx in Cancer. Oof. Saturn also rules the 4th. With Venus under the beams this feels like father issues and maybe the father also being... Domineering, absent a lot?, abusive? To the native and the mother potentially. Potentially something the native carried on to their partner(s) as the ruling planet is opposite Venus ruler of the 7th.

Because Mars is the ruler of the 1st and 6th, this could also speak to health issues.

Mars and Saturn are also in opposition to sun/Mercury/Venus and square Jupiter. Not easy. Feels very temperamental, could speak to mental health issues.

Venus combust is not my favorite. Could be love affairs.

Jupiter in the 12th house is a bummer but not the worst thing in this chart. Could speak to more death surrounding the native. 

 5 Do you share any similar placements? How do those placements manifest for you?

I'm a Scorpio rising, and I have Saturn rx (but not Mars) opposite my Sun/Venus/Mercury. I have some father issues myself but I doubt as bad as the native, because I have a day chart and my Saturn is not in Cancer. But I think they are also the investigative (Scorpio rising) and logic driven (Saturn Mercury) type that could be a late bloomer (Saturn Sun) like me.

I feel like this question is a set up to being like here's all the things you have in common with (terrible person) so I think I'll stop lol."
yodhdd,ivqqtmc,2KatEyes,2022-11-09 22:32:26,1,"This chart is shown without degrees.  Degrees are extremely important in the analysis of a chart, so I don't know why they were excluded.  For instance, I don't know if the sun opposite mars/saturn has a 2 degree orb or a 10 degree orb - and that makes a difference."
yodhdd,ivex432,SivaDaDestroyer,2022-11-07 13:58:37,2,"Mars, first house ruler, also opposite Venus, 7th house ruler.  This should make polemics and opposition even stronger."

wyepd4,ilwb8od,tactman,2022-08-26 17:44:08,10,"Why?

Answer: Because

I got next to nothing from my practicum. It was not a good experience, a lot of frustration.

The company was trying out a new platform and our team could not really get meaningful results. Other teams were working on other platforms and more mainstream stuff so they were fine.

I won't go into any details - NDA and just want to put it behind me.

Edit: my employer paid for it so I don't care about the cost - just felt like a wasted opportunity for me."

wyepd4,ilwbxy7,fats_mcdonald,2022-08-26 17:48:36,7,One thing I have heard that is plausible is that it takes a lot of time/legwork for ga tech to acquire the third party projects and its to compensate for that.  That doesn't really explain why someone doing an employer project should bear that cost except to share the burden.  At the end of the day the overal value of the program is so good that i'm inclined to look the other way.

If i take 1 class/semester (including summer) I'd finish by Spring 2024, but if double up next fall (either 2 classes or 1 class + Practicum) can just be done by Fall 2023.

I'm  just concerned on how much effort is given to Practicum given its 6 credits so can decide if should take it by itself or can combine with another class while still working FT."
wyepd4,ily6fo1,Quantnyc,2022-08-27 01:43:49,1,Me neither. I was just wondering.
zqce7b,j0xhnqo,beebutterflybreeze,2022-12-20 03:27:11,5,"i completed all of my hours in the minimum of 104 weeks, starting while i was still in school at a practicum site. i found a site that would let me make 
 my own schedule and work when patients wanted to meet and when i could meet them: evenings and weekends, because i was working my day job during the week. i focused myself on finding and prioritizing couples and teen patients to make sure those hours ticked down at the same pace as my other hours—too many folks get hung up there not having those hours and not being able to take the test until they do. i found supervisors who were comfortable signing off on classes and trainings and phone calls and patient research and any little thing i did related to therapy work— so not a moment got wasted and everything counted. i maxed out all of my non face to face hours with trainings and classes and such, and i carried a full case load with no vacations or pauses except when i had covid for two years. huge sacrifice! but it’s done and i’m very happy to be licensed and and all set up in PP. The key for me was, well, all of that stuff! Supervisor and site flexibility are KEY."
zqce7b,j0xgdqm,DoctorSweetheart,2022-12-20 03:17:04,2,Why billable hours? Are you allowed to get paid during prac?
zqce7b,j0xi4td,Dependent_Biscotti12,2022-12-20 03:30:56,2,"Also in northern CA, AMFT, 10 client hours was the max for me and my colleagues/classmates. If you’re having difficulty getting 10 clients, I would talk to your supervisor. 
If you’re referring to hours specific to graduation and not BBS hours, my school was lenient in what they would count as hours, and that could vary from school to school with regards to what they count as hours."
zqce7b,j0yb3rf,carlrogersglasses,2022-12-20 08:45:15,2,"Although it sucks- make sure to overschedule yourself to account for the no call no shows for your own caseload. Also, shadowing other clinicians counts as direct hours."
zqce7b,j0xoy48,Agile_Acadia_9459,2022-12-20 04:28:23,1,We had an MFT student last year. They saw most of their clients in the evenings because that’s when they could actually get the relational hours they needed. They didn’t have an outside job but did have a heavy course load and a toddler. Is it possible for you to do your hours at your work? How flexible can your employer be with your schedule? Do you have a practicum site?
zqce7b,j0xi2z3,revosugarkane,2022-12-20 03:30:32,1,"Thank you for breaking that down! Yeah, I’m starting to see how little time I will have during my practicum/internship. Hopefully I can find a site with flexible hours, too."

zqce7b,j0xiocc,revosugarkane,2022-12-20 03:35:14,1,"Yeah, my school is lenient as well, but I’d rather my hours count for both and my school says that’s a possibility."
zqce7b,j0zih5s,revosugarkane,2022-12-20 16:02:37,1,"Ooh good advice I was worried about that, thank you"

However, I believe I am not allowed to be paid while earning hours for practicum per my university’s rules."
zqce7b,j0xqf7a,DoctorSweetheart,2022-12-20 04:41:54,1,O ok! The only thing I can think of is placement at sites with lots of hours.
zqce7b,j0xq1dj,Agile_Acadia_9459,2022-12-20 04:38:19,2,"Maybe? Double check that. There has been a lot of pushback against unpaid internships and schools are starting to take the hint that the need to eat trumps purity of the experience. Also, maybe find out if there is a way you can count developing the internship program towards your hours."
zqce7b,j0xqi7d,revosugarkane,2022-12-20 04:42:41,1,"Right, I’ll double check that. 

Oh, yeah, I have school hours that take up about 40% of my hours required for graduation, which makes my workweek a lot lighter"

As for directly applying to a job, just make sure you have a cover letter and resume. 

For the cover letter, mine have always been pretty short. Keep them simple and straight to the point imo, principals don’t like reading a novel of fluff from my experience. Basically it should just be - “I’m perfect for this job because of x, y, z (experience, core values).”

Progressive care is pretty much step-down, so that's very close to the ICU IMO, but you can also get some pretty cool critical care experience within the ED. 

Since you already work in the ICU, I think you're kinda a shoe-in for ICU residency programs. I know in my state a few hospitals wouldn't even look at my application because I didn't work as a tech in the ICU.

TLDR: Do the one that excites you."
zpb2rj,j0s4d2g,Skeatsie,2022-12-19 00:16:33,5,"Both have advantages, it’s really a matter of preference. Plenty of nurses with both PCU and ED experience transfer to ICU. In PCU, you’ll have higher (but not highest) acuity, working with the same patients all day (so you’ll have a better opportunity to see patient progression/improvement and disease progression/patient decompensation). In ED, you’ll get a chance to see and briefly care for ICU level patients. Ideally, you only have them for a short time (depends on ICU beds available). You would see what the start of the process looks like, which may be especially interesting if you plan to specialize in trauma ICU. Downside: your ICU level patient(s) is not your only patient, nor do they decrease your patient load. Patients who can’t wait go into the first open room. If there is more than one, whoever is in charge of placing patients will try to spread the wealth. If you have the only open bed, they go to you regardless of what your patient acuity load looks like. It can be overwhelming. That said, in my experience, the ED has an incredible team vibe and you won’t be alone in caring for them.

Do what interests you most. You’ll find that your current ICU experience helps you get whatever job you ultimately want (I can say that from personal experience."
zpb2rj,j0uwtty,jack2of4spades,2022-12-19 16:39:24,2,"Hot take. If you're set on going ICU, go to the ED instead. You won't get as much out of your clinicals as you might think, and while it'll be good for networking, you'll learn far more in the first month working in an ICU than you will during clinicals at a PCU. So instead treat clinicals for the ability to see different units and how they work. You'll likely see and do more in the ED and it'll give you a better idea for what their side is doing/going through when you become an ICU nurse."
zpb2rj,j0v3tm5,JelodyLartholomew,2022-12-19 17:25:26,2,"Does your ICU get more ED admissions or rapids from the PCU? If ED, go there so you can see the other side before they come to ICU.

ED would also expose you to different age groups, chief complaints, and work flow. I would probably go ED."
zpb2rj,j3g0sgl,mmoyborgen,2023-01-08 08:00:32,1,"ICU is very unique, PCU is very unique as is ED.  

There are some transferable skills within them all, I'd suggest taking the ED over the PCU.

With ED you'll deal with more variety of patients with varying issues.  You'll likely have a lot more practice to do blood draws and IVs.

PCU is great experience too, but personally from the experience I've gotten so far I'd say I've learned a lot more in the ED."

y0mvao,iruezr7,EuphoricToe1,2022-10-11 02:51:45,5,"Taking a stab at this as a complete beginner! My first time making a genuine attempt to read a chart when I don't know who it belongs to. I purposely didn't read anyone else's answers so sorry if this is duplicates a lot of what others have already added!

For career, with a Leo-ruled 10H and the Sun in the 1H, plus the MC in the 11H of groups (perhaps ""audiences"" if you see where I'm going), I'm going to say some sort of performance artist, like actor, since the matters of the house ruling career and the house ruling matters of the self are tied (especially by the Sun). 

For what they are most known for, with the ruler of the 10H in Scorpio, plus that bonanza Scorpio stellium and Pluto on the MC with Uranus, and assuming they are an actor, I'd say playing a super dark role where they really dove into a villainous character. Something like The Joker from Batman.

For three main characteristics, that 1H Scorpio stellium (especially with both luminaries) is such a kicker, so I'd say there's at least a high level of intensity. Plus, the ruler of that stellium is exalted in Capricorn! With Mars there in the 3H, perhaps a forceful communicator (quick and to the point). Something about Saturn in the 5H of creativity and pleasures, in addition to the ruler of the 7H in Capricorn, gives me a severe vibe too, at least with interpersonal interactions with this person.

Thanks so much for this!! I learn best when its hands on like this. Can't wait to learn from everyone!"
y0mvao,irtuqt2,tiawyn,2022-10-11 00:15:38,8,"Alright, I'll jot down my process for learning and reflecting purposes.  The first thing I did was try and calculate the birthdate using my ephemeris.  I looked at Pluto, and noticed a few things about Pluto.  1) It's in Virgo, so to me as a Scorpio Pluto, this chart is older by at least 1 generation, like my mother's age.  2) It's located on top of the Midheaven, which I thought was peculiar, and 3) it's conjunct with Uranus with a 1-degree orb.  

I used my ephemeris out of Parkers' Astrology, my favorite book so far with my intermediate skills.  I found that looking at the degree of Pluto and then the conjunct Uranus in Virgo, then looked at the degree of the Sun, which then I concluded the date is >!November 21, 1965.!<

Next, I looked into the conjunction of Pluto and Uranus.  I went to AstroSeek's transit calculator and found that the last time this conjunction happened was >!1965, 1966 !< and before that 1851 in Aries.  I referenced Parkers' Astrology once again and looked at their definition of what that conjunction means, which also stated the importance of this aspect and that it only happens every 115 years.  This seems textbook out of here since it stated ""It is a vibrant planetary energy source, and those who have virgo personalized or that sign on the Midheaven [which it is in this case], will tend to be leaders of their generation: it encourages change and drastic action.""  It goes on to say that if this conjunction is badly aspected, this individual may have some psychological problems or addiction.  In this chart, the conjunction is squaring Mercury in Sagittarius; but it is also supported by Uranus and Ascendant sextile and Venus trine.

Now, answering the questions, what is the person's career?  I'm told to look at two places in regards to career.  Usually, career is in the 10th house, midheaven, Sun, and Saturn.  10th house in this chart is in Leo.  Leo's chart ruler is the Sun, which we already have to look at anyway.  The sun is at the 28 degree in Scorpio, not too far off from the Ascendant in the 1st house, which makes it ""doubly powerful"" (Parkers), which I think just explains the celebrity status, maybe ""famous for being famous"" type of people like the Kardashians or Hiltons or something.

2nd question is what are they most known for?  Utilizing whole signs and midheaven, not sure if I'm using this correctly, but the MC being in the middle of 11th house of friends, maybe this tells me that they are known for having friends in high places.

3rd question of 3 main characteristics best describing the personality, their stellium with all big 3 being in Scorpio, I'm guessing they just embody being a Scorpio, very emotional but not letting anyone know about their emotions, especially since the Moon is behind the Ascendant (would be in 12th house).  Scorpio's rulers being Mars and Pluto, Mars is exalted in their 3rd house of Capricorn, Pluto is also exalted in 11th house of Virgo.  Scorpios are capable of passion and have powerful intuition.  They also have inner willpower and determination and the ability to survive the most challenging of circumstances, so they may have had a lot of past failures in life, but they still persevered.  

Thanks for this opportunity, I love utilizing these books that I bought for my own studies.  Wanting to get Hellenistic Astrology by Chris Brennan next!

Edit: blackout date in case someone doesn't want spoilers. 

I might come back and add more."
y0mvao,irv1595,Curious-Can4908,2022-10-11 06:47:11,5,"1) persons career

I'm going to go with singer or some other type of artist. Saturn is opposite the MC in pisces, which is turning an artistic hobby into work. Pisces is often art or music. I think singing because the MC is ruled by mercury in Sagittarius (detriment) which is squaring MC/pluto/uranus and also loosely squaring saturn in the 5th as well. This points to challenges with communication and having to work to be understood in a way that is different, artistic, and transformative. The MC in the 11th house of audiences/groups and the 10th house ruled by Leo with sun/moon/neptune in the 1st in scorpio is definitely a person who is comfortable being in the spotlight in front of audiences and putting on a very transformative, emotional, and glamorous performance. With MC/uranus/pluto trine venus and mars in the 3rd house, they would be excellent at networking for their career and making friends. 

2) known for 

With venus ruling the 7th house of marriage and cap venus loosely conjunct mars and trine MC/pluto/uranus, they could be known for their romantic relationship(s) in some fashion. The marriage or relationship(s) could be abusive or possessive or very nontraditional or something along those lines. Sex life could be on display with pluto on MC. Neptune on the ascendant aspecting MC could point to being a victim or a victim mentality as well. With neptune there, they could be known for some drug use as well or just seem very ethereal. Overall the person has a dark, mysterious, sexy, and very unique vibe. 

3) 3 characteristics of personality 

1) I would think this person would be more introverted and private, but able to turn on the charm when needed with the scorpio energy vs sun in 1st and leo 10th. 
2) Would have a blunt and matter of fact communication style. Could say some very out there things or have have some odd beliefs. Could make people laugh with their truth telling and random thoughts. Mercury in Sagittarius square uranus/pluto/saturn. 
3) Could have a lot of trauma they've overcome that could make them insightful and empathetic, but untrusting or paranoid at times. Scorpio ascendant and pluto conjunct MC and opposite IC. Jupiter/NN in the 8th is growth and luck through transformations, endings, and beginnings."

u/Curious-Can4908 : ""I'm going to go with singer or some other type of artist.""

y0mvao,irsriek,WishThinker,2022-10-10 19:27:53,9,"I think this person is some kind of voice actor or professional speaker. 

first house ruled by mars, in 3rd in capricorn, ruled by saturn in 5th in pisces. This string makes me think that whatever the native is doing, is busy and creative and has to do with communicating or speaking a lot. moon involved, and sextile mars who is kinda nice in this chart, makes me think of energetic fluctuations like this person is a cartoon voice actor who rushes from gig to gig and is always changing voices.

looking from lot of spirit, and at the moon in 2nd progressions (which I am doing some mental adjustment for so could be way off), natives first libra chapter closes at about 7/8 years, the progressed moon is in 4th house by this time? I figure a parent or sibling passed away, I guess parent because 4th house ruled by Saturn. 

next chapter is 15 years, and I think when this virgo chapter ended at about 22 years, the progressed moon would have been up in 10th in leo, so I think this is when the career took off or blossomed.

\-

I think they are best known for being able to hold a poker face or otherwise keep their inner thoughts and feelings submerged, because scorpio can be such a reserved 'watchful' sign and both sun and moon are there, but I feel like they have control over it because the ruler is in a sextile aspect and similarly received in his sign. so if they aren't an actor I think their friends and family think they really could be.

3 characteristics to describe: social butterfly (venus in 3rd), optimistic thru adversity (jupiter in 8th), most creative through hardship (saturn in 5th)

please roast me if im way off base haha"
y0mvao,is18wfi,schwaschwaschwaschwa,2022-10-12 15:52:21,3,"The angular planets are Moon, Mercury and Venus.

With the Ascendant lord in the third house in close sextile with the 1st house Moon ruling the 9th, this person seems well-travelled. Perhaps she travels or tours for work. Possibly got a good education, but the Moon and Mars aren't necessarily that academic, seems like someone with strong ideas about things however.

Venus is the most angular and she is in her terms, does this person have a family who encouraged her creativity, artistry or some other Venusian thing? Not necessarily for a career but in general.

Mercury in the 2nd. Not much to say on it. With the Mercury-Jupiter reception this person could be involved in innovation or modernisation of traditionally oriented or structured things whether with new technologies, approaches, interpretations or ways of making a profit from things.

Regarding personality, no idea, that's not my interest.

0 confidence here, thanks for the fun thread!"
y0mvao,is1le23,geophagustapajos,2022-10-12 17:13:59,3,"I'm ready to be wrong!

>1. What's the person career?

My feelings keep coming back to poet or eccentric lyrically driven singer. The Mars (chart ruler) and Venus combo in the third house, and the trine from MC to that Venus is big writer/communication energy. Venus is also the sect benefic and is associated with the arts.The ruler of the third in the fifth is creative and driven but in a Pisces emotionally driven way. The ruler of the fifth in the eighth feels like income for the native is dependent on patrons/other people (I've seen this in other artists, where it's not like you're working in an office). Ruler of the eighth in the second confirms this. There is at least mutual reception here (both being in detriment) but it still feels somewhat uncertain or a lot of work had to go into making it and it can be inconsistent at times. 

> 2. ​ What are they most known for?

That MC/Pluto/Uranus combo is that 60's era combo of anti war free love rebellious and eccentric offbeat revolutionary energy. Pluto on that MC it feels like being the voice of a generation, and Uranus colors it, er, weird. Unusual and groundbreaking and unpredictable. Could integrate tech in some way? The ruler of the tenth in the first co present with Neptune and the moon in Scorpio feels like their career focuses on the very watery, emotional, passionate, and maybe dark tinged side of life.

> 3. ​ Three main characteristics best describing the personality

While Scorpio risings can be reserved the sun in the first is very front and center energy, as well as the moon in the first being vulnerable and open about deep and painful emotions. Neptune in the first is sort of a shimmering mirage feeling... Do you really know this person, really? Can you ever? With the ASC sextile to MC and Venus their career and work is a big part of their personality. 

This isn't three so let me try to distill:

1. Wants to be center stage

2. Emotional, passionate, vulnerable, nebulous

3. Identifies strongly with career


Side question: this chart looks not great for having children, did they ever have them? If I had guess I think they were childless or otherwise have a difficult relationship or their children are troubled."
y0mvao,irtref5,Anomenly,2022-10-10 23:48:57,2,"Q1. What is this person's career?

Does this person have a career in information technology/computers? Or perhaps in revolutionary journalism? (MC in Virgo conjunct Uranus).

Q2. What is this person known for?

Is this person known for asking good questions? (Pluto in Virgo conjunct MC). Is this person know for challenging the status quo and making new rules, changing the game? (Uranus conjunct MC). Is this person known for being an interesting talk show host or interviewer? Maybe even an interragor? (MC in 11th whole sign house, MC ruler in ""detriment""). Does this person focus a lot on financial matters of their audience? (Assuming they have an audience). Is this person known for being strategic? (Ruler of Leo 10th whole sign house of reputation is Sun in Scorpio in 1st).

Q3. Three main characteristics best describing their personality:

• good work ethic (Mars exalted in Capricorn ruling 1st and 6th whole sign houses)
• bold (Pluto on MC, Mars as L1 exalted, sun in 1st)
• surprisingly sensitive, potentially reactive (Uranus on MC, moon in antithesis in Scorpio, Neptune in 1st house).

Let me know how I did! Thanks for organizing this.

Q4. Bonus prediction that seems notable. Let me know if I should delete this part.

Looks like these upcoming eclipses will activate both their moon (on October 25th) and DSC (November 08). 

Perhaps on October 25th fate will bring to them some circumstances that will direct their awareness towards their philosophy of mothering and family (moon rules 9th whole sign house Cancer). Perhaps they will need to address some health issues at this time.

Perhaps on November 8th their partnership (if they're in one) may need to go under some adjustments or retuning."
y0mvao,iruz4sh,extraterrestrialego,2022-10-11 06:19:55,2,"Thanks for this, this was fun 

I would guess their career involves communication in some form. There is a truth seeking aspect to their Sagittarius Mercury, square Virgo Pluto and Uranus on the MC. Maybe a little ahead of their time, they might have opinions that are controversial to the public. They are visionary in a way, with Uranus on the MC and Neptune on the ascendant. 

My guess is that their work involved organizing a lot of information. Uncovering things using intel and insights that they gathered from others. They might have luck using contacts that are close to home, or close friends maybe even siblings. Jupiter in the 8th ruling their Mercury, opposite Mars in the 3rd.

I would also guess that their process involved writing in some form and if they did any public speaking or reporting, that this was a crucial step for them. After organizing their thoughts and arguments, they could then speak off the cuff. With that Mercury square Pluto / Uranus, their words had power. 

I would guess their work was revolutionary in some way. Something to do with shaking things up, sparking changes in the way things used to be done. 

I would also guess that this person had some difficulties with their mother in their early life, maybe even causing them to rebel in some way? Or maybe being themselves wasn’t acceptable when they were younger. This is a person who wasn’t meant to conform, so maybe that caused troubles when they were younger?

Career: some kind of journalist? Or maybe a lawyer / politician? 

Most known for: shaking up the status quo 

Three words to describe them: ground-breaking, visionary and passionate"
y0mvao,irvnsnj,Redrodder,2022-10-11 11:57:45,2,"Congrats for actually doing it! I love the concept. As it is without birth data I cannot use campanus and divisional charts, so I feel a bit limited. But it is too tempting to have some fun.

I would say a strong success factor comes form having 9th and 10th lords in the ascendant, giving the person the drive to live their passion. 4th lord in the 5th also enhances this.  Due to the north node in Gemini which happens to be the pada of the ascendant in this chart, the person could be involved in high tech career. Not to overlook is the ascendant lord in the 3rd house together with Ve, the 7th lord. This could make them a performer in front of the audience, competitive and skillful, maybe a sports figure. There are more possibilities, but I will just list 3: High tech, sports figure or somebody who is skillful with luxury items (like a chef, spa director...) I am also curious if they have been in an abusive relationship. 

I know this is just question 1. I don't have a clue about the 2nd and may have a go at 3 later."
y0mvao,irw9x8w,chasingtheirtails,2022-10-11 14:54:43,2,"1. actress (a 2(3)x Scorpio (incl. the Moon) like her should be able to put on masks and portray different emotions convincingly. also the 10th ruled by the Sun in Scorpio in the 1st). maybe comedian (Sag Merc). I wanna say singer/voice actor as well but Merc being in detriment in Sag is a wild card. I can't think of other ""celeb"" careers
2. her look (all that Scorpio), her takes, her humor (Scorpio combined with Sag Merc)
3. edgy, brooding (Scorpio of course), blunt (Sag Merc)"
y0mvao,irwmfp0,Resident_Scholar_677,2022-10-11 16:18:49,2,"1.CAREER: The career of this celeb is possibly a famous for serving/communicating, or figuring out unknown information for society...She could be a powerful Researcher, Doctor, politician, Huge Media influencer, singer(Jupiter=Expansion- in Gemini)because of that triple scorpio sun,moon,and ASC and Virgo on the MC...or Possibly works with powerful Software industry in communications like (Apple,Microsoft).

2. IDENTITY:Possibly most known for service(virgo mc), being passionate,a leader, agression, or getting suprising powerful information(Scorpio placements)and probably criticisms(virgo).Definitely a household name with sun in scorpio at (28degrees) but overall this person is Definitely known for theyre Speech because of that Jupiter in Gemini at (29 degrees) directly across from Mars in cappy at (5 degrees) both of those are FAME degrees! 

3. PERSONALITY: Powerful speaker!!(Exalted*Mars in cappy in 3rd house),Strong, passionate, emotional, thoughtful, always thinking, agressive approach, intimidating, Very intelligent, Very mysterious!! (Scorpio in BIG 3) probably also religious/spiritual with (sagg in mercury)"
y0mvao,iry86zw,Waitswitheyes,2022-10-11 22:38:13,2,"I love this idea and thank-you for posting this!

I'm possibly cheating slightly because I know who this is being a fan of theirs from way back (and probably that I'm a bit older than a lot of other people on this sub.) So I'm not going to participate by answering the questions directly and hopefully not give away too much in my answer - but do want to practice my novice chart interpretation skills here if that's OK? OP  - Please delete if not.

With their Big 3 all in Scorpio and all in 1st house they are intensely emotional, enigmatic, creative and with capacity to embrace both the dark and light in life and have possibly experienced plenty of both (speaking as a Scorpio Moon conjunct Jupiter myself.) The fact that all these Scorpio placements are ruled by an exalted Mars in Capricorn in the 3rd highlights that they are skilled and gifted communicators (3rd house) - with a predominance of Scorpio in the chart in the 1st this becomes about communicating their deep emotions, their quest to uncover the deeper truths of the things they are interested in in life, their concern with relationships and being needed, wanted, accepted, loved (deeply.) However they do this in a disciplined way (Mars in Capricorn) - and are very hardworking. With Pluto and Uranus on the MC they present to the public as eccentric, innovative, 'left of field' in relation to their peers, powerful, 'a force' - with sudden or possibly chaotic or unexpected changes in career trajectory and public perception along the way as well.

The final dispositor of the chart is Mercury in Sagittarius in the 2nd house - all other placements in the chart end up coming back to this as their ruler. Interestingly Mercury is in detriment in Sagittarius - which belies the fact that this person is highly skilled at what they do and celebrated as such - but they do communicate their messages in oblique, indirect and eccentric ways that can be quite easily misinterpreted and misunderstood by many. The fruits of their labour certainly has been and continues to be received as such throughout their career thus far.

The final dispositor as Mercury in the 2nd again reinforces the idea that they support themselves (2nd house - personal finances, material possessions) through their communication (Mercury.)

Edit - so being still a novice I may be using the idea of 'dispositor' incorrectly upon further research! But interesting that the chart has ruler of 2nd house (Jupiter) in mutual reception to ruler of 8th (Mercury) and Jupiter is domicile in Sagittarius."
y0mvao,is78akh,petr_9,2022-10-13 20:20:45,3,"> that 1H Scorpio stellium (especially with both luminaries) is such a kicker, so I'd say there's at least a high level of intensity. Plus, the ruler of that stellium is exalted in Capricorn! With Mars there in the 3H, perhaps a **forceful communicator**

Just processing this for myself, I went to read about Björk. This was good practice to see what fits, what didn't and what I overlooked.

She's very well-travelled, tours for work and went to music school. So academic after all, but in a practical way as well. That makes sense. She is not highly political but does have some strong ideas about the protection of nature and has made some public stands in support of the independence movements of nations. Her ideas are more personally oriented, running through her lyrics.

She was a child star which would have required strong parental support; her step father was a musician.

She's known as one of the most innovative artists working with new approaches and technologies often bringing genres and musical structures together into new forms. She also works with traditional/classical forms of music especially those stemming from her home country Iceland."
y0mvao,is4u677,swaon_dav,2022-10-13 09:21:04,2,"Nice job! :) I have one question about ""Venus their career and work"". How Venus is signifying those? As being only sect benefic or? The native has two children. Saturn is in Pisces, the exaltation of Venus and Venus is with exalted Mars in domicile of Saturn, both in whole sign sextile reception. This is productive not only for art but also for children. Ruler of 5th retrograde coming from its exaltation place. Maybe children and conceiving are not easy theme for the person, but she had enough to make it happen."

y0mvao,is80xi1,EuphoricToe1,2022-10-13 23:38:46,3,"Oh I'll watch that once the chart is revealed! Thanks for the spoiler warning!

Also as an aside, I love Astro-Seek so much. It's consistently reliable and I'm always so impressed at the range of things I'm able to look up! Just yesterday, I was curious to see if my transits would reflect the two minor car accidents I'd been in in the past 48 hours, only to see the transit Mars opposite natal Mercury description warn to be careful with driving- you're more prone to accidents during this transit. Many thanks for all that you do with that!"
y0mvao,irvvfc8,EuphoricToe1,2022-10-11 13:07:19,3,"This doesn't need to count as my official guess because I already posted one, but another thought I'm having is that perhaps this person is a politician- that would tie together the ruler of the 9H and 10H being in the 1H in a similar way (centering their career on themselves in some way, as well as exposure to other kinds of thinking), and with the MC in the 11H, the ""public"" would certainly be an important theme in their life. Plus, the ruler of the MC Mercury is in Sagittarius, and though in fall, might lend them a sense of grandness and posturing that politicians aim to give speeches with. Their fallen Jupiter in Gemini might help with that too. 

In that scenario, with Pluto and Uranus on the MC, I could see them being most well known for really shaking up the political power structure in some way, whether from some legislature they made or by their presence (being female, her presence alone might shake things up... so sad that that's the case!).

The strong drive seen in this chart with Mars in Capricorn could also be applicable (maybe more so) to a politician. Same with the intensity seen by the Scorpio stellium- a willingness to dig down to get to the bottom of a power structure in order to make changes, maybe even revolutionize. With Mercury and Jupiter where they are, I would also say possibly odd or unusual speech patterns, word choice, something to that effect (though that may not really be a personality trait!)."

y0mvao,is1d6ix,schwaschwaschwaschwa,2022-10-12 16:20:30,1,"By angular I mean they are making a degree-based connection to the ac, dc, mc or ic specifically within 3° for all planets, except the Moon, whose range is 13°. Otherwise known as the condition of being ""busy"". Many astrologers give this 5°, but I use the orbs of application and separation I would give to the planets ordinarily.

Moon 6° Scorpio is 9° from joining the Ascendant. Mercury 18° Sagittarius looks like it is 2° from squaring the Midheaven. Venus at 15° Capricorn is in a partile sextile with the Ascendant/trine with the Descendant.

I don't use the outer planets, so I didn't look at them."
y0mvao,is52oq5,geophagustapajos,2022-10-13 11:12:27,2,"For the Venus ASC sextile I mainly felt because it was placed in the third and Venus significations include the arts and that Venus is additionally trine the MC it is a triangle that feels like it binds the personality to her artistic work. The ASC-Venus alone wouldn't make me think that but more the overall triangle to be honest. 

Ah interesting about the children. I've not been good at predicting whether someone has children or not. My friend who is a Scorpio rising with Venus Sun Mercury in Pisces and also has Jupiter in Gemini is childless. I will need to go back to the drawing board again. :)"

I could be very wrong, but I think you can trace back the rulerships of all planets in the chart to Mercury. I use traditional rulers only though.

E.g Sun in Scorpio - Mars in Cap - Saturn in Pisces - Jupiter in Gemini - Mercury in Sag

E.g 2 Venus in Cap - Saturn in Pisces - Jupiter in Gem - Mercury in Sag

Eg 3 Moon in Scorpio - Mars in Cap - Saturn in Pisces - Jupiter in Gem - Mercury in Sag

y0mvao,is558s8,swaon_dav,2022-10-13 11:39:28,2,"Oh I see. So your friend with Scorpio rising has exalted Venus + debilitated Mercury, whereas Jupiter is in detriment. Venus rules 7/12 houses + Mercury 8/11. So both malefic houses 12/8 are in 5th. I know few people who has debilitated Mercury in reception with detriment Jupiter in Pisces-Gemini and they are childless as well. Jupiter in 8 also is not very supportive of 5th. Venus being exalted on paper should cancel the debilitated Mercury. But Mercury is not only in its debilitation, it is also in his detriment, so Venus can only improve 50% of Mercury or maybe more if Venus ruled better houses."

y0mvao,is56qba,geophagustapajos,2022-10-13 11:54:07,1,"So you think the mercury being there has a somewhat malefic effect on having children?

y0mvao,irtcv6d,swaon_dav,2022-10-10 21:56:27,1,I see. The spirit is in 12 house and it's ruler in 3d (4h from it). So what do you made out of it?
y0mvao,is59l6u,swaon_dav,2022-10-13 12:20:53,2,"I'm sure there's more to this configuration. Venus in 5th with Sun, ruler of 10H will show high creativity, esp when comes to relationships and self-expression. But the ruler of 5th Jupiter is in bad shape from what I gathered. That's the difference. Also where are Moon, Mars, Saturn? Moon plays vital rule in female chart for progeny."
y0mvao,irth3xg,WishThinker,2022-10-10 22:28:16,2,"I havnt ever looked at lots beyond the releasing periods, but from this I would say that the 3rd house is foundational to the identity and proper embodiment of the 12th house, or that communication / community is foundational to the wellbeing of the spirit 

also since the lot of spirit is angular with 3rd, and 3rd contains the ruler of the 1st, I would say their career or overall life direction (key phrase for lot of spirit) is wrapped up in this person really embodying the third house characteristics. like how they communicate is WHO they are lol.

however, I believe lot of fortune designates ""peak periods"" or times in life when releasing techniques really activate, and the lot of fortune is in sagittarius second house, a mutable sign in a succedent house, so ""peak periods"" will be in mutable/succedent houses in this persons life and not necessarily when the lot of spirit or 3rd house get transited / activated"
y0mvao,is5ano0,geophagustapajos,2022-10-13 12:30:12,1,"Hmm yeah, that's my feeling too that children have to do with more than just the fifth house. She has a Leo moon, Saturn in Capricorn, and Mars is with Jupiter."
y0mvao,irtlu4e,swaon_dav,2022-10-10 23:04:35,2,I think I got what you mean. :)
y0mvao,is5cdgr,swaon_dav,2022-10-13 12:44:37,2,"Interesting, 5th from Moon Leo is Sag and again Jupiter rules over it, being in detriment. Any idea of Jupiter is retro? Moon rules 5th from Pisces and it's in 6th from it. Most planets are in very adverse positions from one another, which can partially explain the situation."
y0mvao,is5foi6,geophagustapajos,2022-10-13 13:10:51,1,"No she actually only has one retrograde planet, Pluto. (I'm jealous because I have six.🙃) My only other thought is Mars is her chart ruler/ruler of 6th in the 8th house and I guess you need relatively good health for getting pregnant. 

This would make sense for the mystery chart here- Mars is in great condition. She would be healthy enough for children and there's not much to suggest she wouldn't want them.

(Extra research note for me: do men's charts require the same health requirements?)

Sorry I just realized how much of your time I've taken up here! My bad. I could talk astrology all day. 😅"
y0mvao,is9ku1b,swaon_dav,2022-10-14 08:41:06,1,"Ah, I'm happy to discuss anything astrology. You haven't taken anything :) Yes ruler of 1st is crucial for health. Mars in 8th Gemini with detriment Jupiter shows her strong desire for creative expression (as kids as well). Mars in Gemini and Mercury in Pisces, shows very mentally active person,who can be disturbed if they don't know how to ease their mind and thoughts."

z5dde5,ixvhes8,electradice,2022-11-26 18:18:55,2,"Hi! Thanks for sharing your perspective, this is super helpful. I was in touch with the director of a small private school. We didn’t even discuss specific teachers since the practicum is so far away (April), it was more about doing a placement at the school in general. For all the emails at the beginning he responded extremely quickly, but you are right perhaps it is just a busy period for them. I will follow everyone’s advice and do a quick phone call at some point, thanks :)"

But yes, we do get bombarded with emails. A little follow up nudge email with maybe a cc to the principal and a phone call like others suggested would help. I have definitely appreciated follow up emails when I've totally forgotten to reply to someone. Sometimes the reply is literally sitting in my drafts lol.

I was able to finish my masters but for Texas I had to finish my practicum either in Texas or with DoDEA. I was already a teacher with DoDEA and if I would have completed my practicum with them I would have had to quit. So I just waited to complete the practicum part once I got back to the states. Luckily my spouse at the time was stationed in Texas after Japan so I finished everything and got certified in 2019.

z4sx5k,ixstgpc,Folie_A_Un,2022-11-26 01:43:01,22,"I had a supervisor point out my tendency to be introverted too. There's a baseline level of socialization that the field would like us to be comfortable with. Fear not, the expectation isn't very high, as far as I can tell! I'm still fairly awkward and I do just fine :D 

As far as interacting with colleagues goes, taking a few minutes at a time to engage with people will probably put your supervisor's mind at ease, your colleagues will appreciate your attempts to engage them, and everyone will have a better impression of you overall. 

Ask them questions about their day, the work itself, weekend plans, basic stuff. Making an improvement in this area will also help your work with introverted clients who also struggle with these sorts of interactions and social expectations.

Good luck!"

Second - I can relate and something that was helpful for me was to be sure I spent a minute or two chatting with each colleague each week or every other week even if just checking in on the weekend.

I am a female with a male student roommate who both walk the neighborhood at varying times of the day/evening, and our household has not run into any issues besides a neighbor warning of a bear knocking over garabage cans recently. I do not feel unsafe walking here any more than I'd feel if I was walking anywhere else. 
The murder was targeted; the skull found on the hill has been there for 31 years. Do you know what happened in your neighborhood 31 years ago? Cody Legebekoff murdered a victim in a house a stones throw from the hospital in one of the neighborhoods suggested as an alternative to this neighborhood. 
I'm not here to invalidate anyone's experience, just saying that in 15 years, I haven't experienced the same."

Honestly, crime is getting out of control but a lot of it is drug related or theft related with a bit of violence scattered in between. Crime happens everywhere though so it's always better if walking to do it during the day or in a higher traffic area where there are more eyes, and always lock her doors at home and if a car owner, then car doors as well."
yz4mrd,iwywvmb,altiuscitiusfortius,2022-11-19 12:48:47,14,"NOPE.

It's winter time.  It will be dark when she walks to and from work.

It is not safe to walk in this area after dark.

There was just a shooting and murder there on Tuesday.  Then unrelated they found a buried head from an older murder in that caught.

I live nearby. It is literally the worst area in town.  Its stiill pg, its not as bad as hastings in Vancouver or anything  but its not safe.  Youll see people openly shooting heroin in that area.  Fine to live in if you drive and are a large man, dont live alone etc, but do not walk around in. Especially as a woman.  Lots of sexual assaults.

I work at the hospital.   Join some of the face book groups for it and ask around.  Lots of doctors own rentals a block away from the hospital that they rent put specifically for practicum students or staff that live nearby and have basement suites."
yz4mrd,iwy4y2t,thatsaxycanadian,2022-11-19 06:19:44,8,"Definitely one of the more sketchy areas to live in. I would avoid it if you can.

The neighborhood you circled is relatively safe. The biggest issue in that particular neighborhood is that if a person is walking from the hood to downtown, they have to walk through that neighborhood. There’s a staircase that leads to downtown - which is part of that neighborhoods problems."

In that case, I'm gonna say no — on the walking side alone, it's just not the best access toward the hospital and, for someone with anxiety in a new city alone, probably not the most pleasant. I don't think it's as bad as a lot for the other commenters, there are actually some really nice houses in your circled area, but in this case probably not the right fit. And I would be surprised if she couldn't find something closer. Try the alphabet streets: Alward, Burden, Carney, Douglas, Ewert, so on.

Once you go past 20th there are a lot of slumlord rentals and greenbelt with homeless living in them.

zghq7c,izhly6l,Gazette_Ruki,2022-12-09 04:05:25,5,"Sorry for the long post, but I was in your exact position earlier this year, so I have lots of relevant advice to offer.

I'm a current ALT with the JET Programme.

I'm 7 weeks away from completing the TeachNOW programme, and have submitted 3 of the 5 required videos so far; all videos were given a passing grade by my instructor at Moreland.

BEFORE signing up to the programme, I emailed the clinical team and explained my situation; I also had several Zoom meetings with members of the team to further clarify my situation. Like you, I was worried about the practicum given that I'm an assistant teacher and not the main teacher. They said it would be fine, so long as I'm the main teacher in the videos I submit. So far, this has proven to be true; as I mentioned, I've submitted 3 videos and all have been given a passing grade. The JTE was always with me in the lessons (and in the videos), but I took the main role.

It's also worth noting that your lessons are 45-50minutes, but you only record/send in 15-20 minutes of footage (for the first 4 videos), and 20-30 minutes of footage (for the final video). You're expected to edit the video and show only the relevant parts. If you think that the JTE took too much of a lead role in one of your recordings, just cut those parts out.

I also made sure to contact my BOE and ask for permission to record. I wanted to only record one specific class at one of my schools (I teach multiple classes in multiple schools), so the BOE contacted the principal of the school and asked on my behalf. I received permission, but I'm required to blur my students' faces throughout the video, AND show the video to my principal before submitting it (to confirm that students' identities aren't revealed). Again, so far I've had no issues on this front; every time I've shown my principal the video, it's been given the green light. It's worth noting that I have a very good relationship with all staff members in this school, which no doubt helped in not only securing the requisite permission, but also in the JTE being confident to relinquish his duties to me.

Anyway, each situation is different. Don't give Moreland any money until you've confirmed everything with the clinical team, AND your BOE, AND the principal of the school you wish to record at.

Also, you didn't ask this, but a bit of advice. Japan is a popular destination country for international teachers, and getting into the genuine international schools that offer a decent salary and benefits will be difficult; you'll be fighting an uphill battle to get into these schools, as ALT experience doesn't typically count as main teacher experience. If you're content with working at an 'international' school in Japan (i.e., international in name only, and usually with low salary, long working hours, and few benefits), or starting off your career in a country that takes NQTs (China), then you're good. If not, you may want to do an ITT course in your home country and get some domestic experience instead."
zghq7c,izhaaf0,dokoropanic,2022-12-09 02:30:17,3,"I did moreland at a private school.  I teach by myself.  

One of the example videos we had to watch was of a woman in a public Korean school and it was very similar to being an ALT in Japanese schools.  However she was T1 for the part she videoed so I think you would need to be T1 for most of the time to get anything out of it.

Like the commenter below said, your school would have to OK it.  Possibly also your BOE if you are direct hire.  Dispatch might get thorny.  At private schools, most parents sign waivers allowing students to be used for school promotional content and I was told by my admin that waiver covered me videoing class in this context as well.  So, permission is first.

Someone who supervises you will have to digitally sign a document allowing you to tape class and certifying that you did your clinical there at the end.

Moreland can occasionally find people placements teaching online.  I have read in the past people would sometimes teach no one and video that but I am not sure if that is allowed now - nobody in my cohort was like that and I think Moreland is gradually trying to be taken more seriously.  (There was one example video for asynchronous learning but that’s a bit different…)"
zghq7c,izh0p7c,CompleteGuest854,2022-12-09 01:15:43,6,"Have you asked the teacher or principal whether your class can be videoed? That's the first step. If you get a ""no"" then you can't join a program that requires your lessons be recorded.

I have a feeling (and other teachers can confirm if I'm right or wrong) that they likely won't allow this, as it could be considered an invasion of students' privacy. Considering Japan's risk-adverse culture, I can't imagine many parents agreeing to this.

And to be honest, I highly doubt any eikaiwa would let you video your lessons either. The students wouldn't like it (again, privacy issues) and corporate headquarters would not be keen on letting out information about their classes. There might be some exceptions, but I imagine it would be difficult for you to find one, and you'd have to quit your current job.

The problem is, programs like the ones you mention require teachers to be working in contexts where they have full support of the school in getting further education and qualifications. Japan is not such a context, since generally speaking, they don't consider ALTs to be teachers. For the most part ALTs are only seen as an aid, and your career advancement is immaterial to them. And of course eikaiwa don't give a flying eff whether you can actually teach or not, because it's not a requirement of the job. All you need do is look smiley and be entertaining.

This is why Japan is a horrible place to teach - career advancement is immaterial and seen as unnecessary since you're not seen as a real teaching asset - only as a temporary worker.

You'd need to be a full-fledged, full time professional teacher to have full the support of your school or university in taking such a program, as only then would they see you as an asset whose advancement benefits them.

If you want to advance your teaching skills while in Japan, I'd suggest an online CELTA. It doesn't require a teaching practicum so you can do it while you are still working. But honestly? To really further your career, you should probably enter a face-to-face university program, because I don't see how else you'd be able to do a teaching practicum.

But maybe someone else knows more about this than I do, and can suggest something better. I completed my teaching practicum long ago, so am not very up to date on such things. I do hope you manage to find a program. It's really good to see an ALT who actually cares about upskilling."
zghq7c,izqpt96,SnooPineapples608,2022-12-11 03:29:34,2,I've done the Teacher Ready program.  They do not require you video lessons.  But you will need to log 180 hours of observation and then teach for about 40 full time under an experienced mentor at a school.  You need to be a US citizen and fly to USA to pass a series of standardized tests.
zghq7c,izixjbx,kidlekid,2022-12-09 13:22:05,1,"Hey. Just so you know, YOU DO NOT NEED TO VIDEO KIDS for Teach Now. I blacked out the video anytime a child entered the video with the reason being privacy concerns are too strict in Japan."
zghq7c,izicrkr,dokoropanic,2022-12-09 09:11:09,3,"You bring up a real good point that I forgot and I think would make it difficult for some ALTs: you have to video the same group of students now at Moreland.  It wasn’t always that way so sometimes old posts on reddit are outdated.

I know people who finished Moreland and got hired at real intl schools here so it’s not impossible.  They generally knew someone there though, and I don’t live in Kanto where the top schools are."
zghq7c,izh9yo1,tsian,2022-12-09 02:27:48,3,"While I think you are generally right that most schools would be generally opposed to any filming in school, there is some precendent in that demonstration/research classes are sometimes filmed.

Though I would tend to agree that the chance of getting agreement is on the lower end of the spectrum.

In terms of getting support from the school for engaging in teacher training, I think that will depend entirely on the relationship of the individual with their school. A random dispatch ALT who shows up once a month is unlikely to be given any leeway, but a direct-hire stationed at a few (or a single) school(s) with some history in the position, they may be open to accomodating an ALT in some form assuming that ALT is able to continue to fulfill their duties."
zghq7c,izi9mlo,Celerycheesepeanuts,2022-12-09 08:25:49,1,"That’s a good point. A lot depends on the school administration and what measures are in place already to protect student privacy.

I work at a private school, and when students enter the school part of the admissions documentation involves a form with which the parent does or does not allow their kid to be filmed or recorded in school or at school events. Most (but not all) of the parents give permission for this.

I’ve just been a mentor for a trainee on the Moreland program and she had to get permission to record the lessons from the Principal, the parents and the students themselves. While they were not comfortable with the students’ faces or names being on the videos, they were OK with their voices (although the first lesson was pretty excruciating as they were initially reluctant even to speak when it was being recorded) and using nicknames. The teacher therefore had the camera focused on herself and the whiteboard or slides. She also edited it to include her rationale for various activities and take out times when she had gone over to help the students or they were working quietly. It actually worked quite well.

I also had to give my permission for her to record our feedback sessions. Although I don’t particularly like being on camera I soon got used to it and it was for a good cause. If I hadn’t given permission I guess that would have been recorded audio-only too.

Who would you use as a mentor as an ALT?"
zghq7c,izie68j,Gazette_Ruki,2022-12-09 09:31:44,1,"Yeah, it makes it more difficult in the sense that you may only see that class once a week (which is the case with the class I'm recording). If for some reason you don't meet the class that week, e.g, they have an event, you have some compulsory training etc., you lose the opportunity to record and may fall behind on your recordings. This isn't the end of the world, but it would delay you completing the programme.

I'm glad to hear it worked out for them! I'm working on other things, too, in case this doesn't work out. I wonder if those people got hired at the real international schools only due to foreigners being unable to enter the country, presuming that this was during the Covid period."
zghq7c,iziemqo,dokoropanic,2022-12-09 09:38:14,2,"Some of it was because of covid but in general, the money does not flow as much in non-Kanto regions anymore and the student makeup/the way some very old intl schools are doing things is changing.

Some of it is just who you know still, too.  I had a private Japanese student offer to introduce me to the head of school at a really good intl school in my area years ago and I didn’t go for it.  Very stupid decision."

The clear winners were
u/geophagustapajos and u/inner_compass_. Great job! You really understood the chart and pretty much got every question on some level. 

Some notable runner ups were: u/jonnuska, u/waitswitheyes. 

Please let me know if any of you would like to post the next chart. 

1) With the ruler of the MC being saturn retrograde in the 8th house conjunct neptune and uranus, the native was known for her sudden, shocking, and untimely death that was full of confusion as the body was staged and a bizarre ransom note left at the scene. With the trine to mars in the 12th and mercury in the 4th, we can see the incident happened at home by a hidden enemy. With mars sometimes representing violence and mercury being a significator of the mind/brain, we can even see the final blow to the head. Moon conjunct MC shows the association with the mother as a big part of her public life in 9th house as the family was religious. 10th house ruled by jupiter conjunct venus representing the 5th shows she was known for her hobby as well. With moon conjunct the MC as well (moon representing body) opposite sun (mind) squaring mars in the 12th and pluto in the 6th, we can see both mental and physical abuse. Unfortunately autopsy results revealed chronic sexual abuse and was released publicly. 

2) With moon opposite sun both squaring mars and pluto, I think its safe to say parents were at odds with each other and there was much repressed anger and subconscious patterns that had a negative impact on the native. Father was also away a lot for work. Mercury representing home and parents trine mars and saturn show this as well, a bit more constructively. The mother on the MC was a a big part of the natives family life and shows a big focus of the mother on appearances as well as religion. Native was also mommy girl and the golden child. I think the 10th represents mother in this case ruled by jupiter in the 2nd, so I think she could be loving and affectionate most in regards to the hobby of the native. There was a brother. With 3rd house of siblings ruled by sun opposite moon, we can see the siblings were at odds and also that the brother was ostracized by the mother as well. 

3) with venus in cancer ruling the 5th house of hobbies placed in the 2nd trine saturn, we can see beauty (venus) being taken very seriously/as work (saturn) for reward (2nd house). With the jupiter venus conjunction, we can see a level of extravagance as well as luck in this area. The native won many trophies in this area. According to Sue Thompkins book on aspects saturn venus aspects are often seen in beauty contestants. The native was one and well known for it. 

4) with leo sun and gemini rising, the native was known for being very friendly, outgoing, charming, and loved to perform. Her aquarius moon on the MC gave her that bit of quirkiness that made her really stand out from the crowd, especially in her beauty pageants. With her cancer venus, she was known for being very sweet and loving. As she was young when she passed, we will never know the full extent of how her personality would have developed. 

The chart was that of Jon Benet Ramsey. RIP sweet girl."
y6ahpc,isqb92q,Anomenly,2022-10-17 22:17:37,6,"1. *What is the native known for?*  
Looking at the MC (reputation) in Aquarius in the 9th whole sign house, the moon is almost at an eclipse there. The moon is conjunct the north node and is ruling the 2nd whole sign house. The ruler of the MC is Saturn retrograde in Capricorn in the 9th Placidus house, ruling the 8th and 9th whole sign houses.  
Is the native known for pushing the field of knowledge in some form?  
If they have an academic background... - a Ph. D. or something similar to that. Something in the sciences perhaps? I want to say social sciences, but Saturn in Capricorn makes me think of harder sciences... Maybe a blend of both - some sort of super practical psychology, like marketing for example. Or law. Trading or crypto investing is also coming to mind.  
All this could tie in with being a politician, or for making public political statements at least.  
If there's no academic background, I'd imagine they may be the type of person to push ""hot takes.""  
Mars in the 12th house, as ruler of the 11th and 6th whole sign houses, opposite Pluto, makes me think that social media may be difficult for them - frustrating controversies maybe. Maybe seems a bit insecure publicly, tying in to the approaching eclipse at their birth.  

2. *What family dynamics can you see in the chart?*  
Looking at the IC (family dynamics) in Leo in the 3rd whole sign house, the other half of the approaching eclipse. The sun is conjunct the south node is ruling the 3rd whole sign house.  
Was there a loss of a father figure at some point early on? Did the native's sibling need to step into a leadership role, or were they raised by extended family?  

3. *What hobbies do you see in the native's chart?*  
The 5th whole sign house (hobbies) is Libra, ruled by Venus in Cancer in the 3rd Placidus house.My first guess: does the native do food art/design? Or comfortable fashion?  
Mercury on the Placidus 5th house cusp, Virgo, trine Neptune in Capricorn makes me think poet, lyricist, song-writer, rapper. That's my second guess. Maybe they do both?  

4. *What are a few personality traits of the native?*  
Jupiter and Mercury are the planets who hold the most dignity - they're tied, but Mercury is in a better house this native probably leans more towards the dry logician type, maybe not totally dry - I imagine they'd have a bit of a generous streak and some genuinely unique philosophies. Definitely warm... spicy... hot takes... My guess is that they would tend to be on the more extroverted side in public, adaptable, flexible, and open-minded. Their temperament is hot and dry - choleric. A quick thinker and a quick speaker, active, excited, and interesting."
y6ahpc,isvukwz,geophagustapajos,2022-10-19 01:52:57,3,"1) What is the native known for? 

Okay let's see here. Chart ruler is Mercury in Virgo in the 4th, Sun in Leo in third and moon in Aquarius in 9th. The Venus and Jupiter in the second house of resources is very lucky for money and along with Saturn in the 8th of other people's resources.... Giving me someone born into royalty/heir to fortune or wealthy tech CEO vibes. 

The Pisces tenth ruled by Jupiter in Cancer in the second makes me think this person is known for their wealth however potentially may be someone who gives to charity (because Jupiter is exalted). The Mars ruled 11th in 12th though opposite Pluto....... Someone who gets themselves in trouble with friends/community/the public. Maybe someone who has a lot of enemies.

2) What family dynamics can you see in the chart? 

Seems like a family where money was important. Saturn rx in Capricorn in the 8th, Sun in Leo are my potential father significations. This father seems potentially distant or with issues and may have an ego or be domineering. Maybe business or leadership role in life, someone maybe who handled other people's assets.

For the mom we have the moon in Aquarius in the ninth and 4th Virgo with Mercury there. This feels like a mother that might be cold, distant, or exacting, perhaps controlling or very orderly. Maybe she was educated, traveled, was a SAHM, or immigrant.

3) What hobbies do you see in the chart? 

Struggling with this one. Venus ruled fifth in Cancer in second house opposite Saturn. Trying to break this down by archetypes it could be collecting beautiful antiques... Decorating, gardening, cosmetics maybe. Refined but with a sense of comfort. Something classic. Perhaps with the moon in the ninth the hobby involves something philosophical/spiritual/international/technological. With Jupiter there with Venus and Jupiter ruling the tenth they could be known for this- it made them money? Or they spend a lot of money on it?

4) What are a few personality traits of the native?

As a Gemini rising the native may feel a bit fluid or changeable and adaptive. Life is a game they can win. With the Gemini/Aquarius/Leo combo it feels like they believe they're smarter than most and can outwit everyone. But probably also deep inside feels isolated and outcast, different. They are center stage, stubborn with what they believe, but flexible with their identity. They may be... chatty lol. They keep everyone on their toes. They are probably interesting though, and engaging. Marilyn Monroe was a Leo rising, Gemini sun, Aquarius moon and I feel there are similar themes here with the difference being MM was the star doing Gemini stuff and this person being the chameleon doing Leo stuff.


I straight up feel like I didn't do well on this one. I'm not confident at all on this but I need to practice!"

Alright ima give it a go... whew this is tough but ookk LOL..soooo...

1️⃣ The celeb might be known for his/her marriage life or partner they may be in business together probably gain more overseas(part of fortune in sagg at 4deg.)...looking at that vertex in libra(29degrees) (6th house) they do some type of service work for a large amount of people (moon and nn in aqua in 11th house) occupation could be maybe cosmetics or women health group, cosmetic surgeon(venus cancer 20deg) also Aqua MC( likes to be unique, make other people look unique, alter appearance)..The father might be against this(hard line from venus to Saturn) but the mother might be involved.

2️⃣Family dynamics..there could have been alot of tension in this family growing especially emotions and ego struggles, The natives mom look like she plays a big part in the natives thinking pattern very authoritative ( mercury(10deg) 4th house, aspecting uranus/Neptune(cappy)..maybe even manipulated the native too but highly supportive) but native still looks up to the mother for big decisions in life)...Father was probably really hard on native and  suppressed his/her venus/sun traits(Father has scorpio traits)( hard red line from venus to saturn at (20deg) cancer opposite cappy aspecting) Sun in the 4th house mom was more active/dominant than father. Siblings were probably jealous of native fought over money possessions(mars in Taurus (15 deg) opposite Pluto scorpio).

3️⃣Hobbies could include, traveling,shopping, spritual journeys to far away lands to connect with heritage (cancer/sagg)with spouse and mother...(mars Taurus 12th house) (moon 9th deg. 11th house)...media taking photos(Aqua mc) Gemini/sagg asc/dsc ( might like writing reading books/researching)

4️⃣Natives personality is probably focused on Career perfection and healthy ways of living, loves peace, very practical and realistic, shy sometimes (mercury 10deg. Virgo) but sometimes may get influenced by that moon in aquarius and asc in Gemini the air signs...to be free and chat more with people to show theyre dynamic personality and why they're unique."
y6ahpc,istcqxj,EuphoricToe1,2022-10-18 15:41:39,1,"I'm going to interpret this chart through Whole Sign. I'm also a newbie so I welcome feedback!

1. What is the native most well known for? The MC is in Aquarius in the 9H, suggesting a high point in intellectual pursuits, and when combined with the Pisces 10H which gives me a blurring of boundaries and a sense of mysteriousness, I would guess the native is known for intellectual contributions to the exploration of the deep sea, or perhaps space. Moon conjunct the MC furthers the sense of otherworldliness for me. The rulers of the 9H and 10H (Saturn and Jupiter) are in domicile, as in the case of Saturn in Capricorn, or exalted, as with Jupiter in Cancer, suggesting ease and flow in 9H and 10H topics. However, with Saturn being in the 8H and in opposition to Venus in Cancer in the 2H suggests conflict between a desire to utilize the native's resources towards the home/home life, especially with Jupiter's expansive influence perhaps quite extravagantly, and Saturn's more disciplined approach in utilizing other's resources (possibly through the notoriety the native has gained). Though of course that would be impossible to know unless the native has shared that publicly. 

2. What family dynamics are seen in the chart? Looking to the 4H of family, home, and roots, it is ruled by Virgo and has the native's ruler of the AC there, Mercury, which is both in domicile and exalted there. This suggests that family and the home are very important to the native and a core aspect of their identity. With Virgo and Mercury, and especially tying in a Gemini AC, suggests a shifting, moving quality to the family dynamic, both being mutable Mercury-ruled signs. They may have moved frequently. Additionally, Mercury in Virgo suggests an emphasis on knowledge pursuits and understanding the details, meaning that learning may be an important part of the family dynamic. With the IC in the 3H ruled by Leo and conjunct the native's sun, I would think siblings and/or neighbors brought a warmth to the native's upbringing, and perhaps they've shared fond memories of such. 

3. What hobbies does the native have? I would first look at the 5H for creative endeavors. Their 5H is ruled by Libra, with their Venus in Cancer in their 2H. Painting or some sort of visual art is what I get from this; something like watercolors. For hobbies, I believe one might turn to the 3H for daily rituals and such things (opposed to the 9H of more organized and larger scale rituals like religion). For the native, the 3H is ruled by Leo and contains their sun in its domicile. Given other 3H significations, I could see this as reflecting the ""public ness"" of this hobby for the native. 

4. For a few personality traits of the native, with a Gemini AC and Mercury in Virgo, I would guess that some of Gemini's chattiness is tempered by Virgo, but that the native is still very ""airy"" in their thought and communication, liking to hop from one topic to the next. With Mars in fall and in the 12H, I might guess that the native might sometimes be prone to periods of stubborn-fueled isolation as a method of dealing with anger. (The image of someone crossing their arms and refusing to say a word before closing their bedroom door comes to mind.) Their sun/moon opposition so close to the nodes is very striking- between that, their strong Cancer placements, and their AC ruler in the 4H, I would guess the native has a more reserved personality despite being a Leo sun.

The luminaries in opposition and conjunct the MC/IC as well as the nodes is quite striking!"
y6ahpc,isxsk7r,Jonnuska,2022-10-19 14:12:26,1,"Just some thoughts I got from looking at this: sun-Moon opposition could mean tension in the family dynamic, parents opposing each other literally. 
Mother (Moon) conj. MC for me speaks of mothers great influence on this persons career or public image. 
It feels like the hobby is mother inspired as well, but my skills are not good enough to pinpoint what exactly. 

Pluto-Mars opposition brings dynamite to the chart, perhaps an accident, could mean violence, a sudden burst of deep anger/passion. Maybe the individual is s fighter or has the tendency to become angry/violent.

Saturn-Venus opposition speaks of unfulfillment in love life, deep feeling of not deserving love. Rejecting love. Struggles in love. 

These are the main themes i could capture 😬"
y6ahpc,isy1hnx,swaon_dav,2022-10-19 15:14:28,1,"Q1: What is the native known for?

They're known for their meticulous skills of speaking and writing and expressing their ideas. :)

Q2: What family dynamics can you see in the chart?

The native is born on lunar eclipse right on 3/9 houses at Leo/Aq axis. Both Sun and Saturn are in own signs. It shows both parents exist in native's life (meaning not dead), but probably are divorced, since Sun/Saturn are in aversion to each other. Maybe one of them went away and married a foreigner in far place. Therefore the native was raised by one of the parents. The eclipse axis on 3/9 shows mixed family, coming to one's life to enrich or challenge their understanding of family (based on the Nodes as well). The native is learning how to embrace diversity in their family. Sun in 3d also shows younger brother. The native is either father's girl or mommy's boy type, very connected to one of the parents. This is night chart, so Saturn will describe the father. Saturn is in own 8H, showing longevity and inheritance, trine Mercury, ruler of the nativity. So the native is close to their father, who acts as their beneficiary. Moon in night chart shows the mother. Moon rules 2d Cancer and is in Aquarius with Rahu and Saturn in 12 from them. Moon is in 6th from Mercury. Maybe not very smooth relationship with the mother. The  mother had a lot of upheavals in her life.

Q3: What hobbies do you see in the chart?

I think they have few hobbies, after all is Gemini rising with exalted Mercury, which shows versatility in skills and interests. Writing is one of them. Air signs are very much about conceptual thinking. They like to express their ideas and be recognized about it.

Q4: What are a few personality traits of the native?

Gemini rising with exalted Mercury. Communicative, rather serious (trine Saturn), curious, good conversationalist (and interviewer)(trine Mars), explorative, searching for the new, unusual, unconventional (trine Uranus, Neptune). They can be very intense thinkers, analytical and breaking things to the smallest detail (sextile Pluto). In the same time they can be very practical, putting everything they know into practice (Virgo) in service for the benefit of other people (Moon in Aq as triplicity ruler of Virgo) or more precisely women. They can actually be activist very much, socially conscious and dynamic. They are extremely soft spoken and persuasive (Venus/Jupiter in Cancer), caring voice, someone who can be listen to a lot, for their voice alone. That's on the surface. Inside they're quite intense people, struggling with a lot of emotional issues, maybe because of their mother. Mars opp Pluto 12/6H dynamic actually speaks of inner traumas, some hidden suppressed anger. Mars detriment in 12H, bottling up anything negative, trying to be always believing and positive, but Gemini/Virgo double side is pealing off. That can lead to health issues related to sexuality, body image, self loading. Maybe they're very interested in psychology (Saturn in 8H trine) and they like to talk about it (Jupiter in 2d) in public (Moon on MC). Or they like to tell their own story and struggles, writing about it in book/s. Something between those lines."
y6ahpc,it3p0ip,arefs11,2022-10-20 18:28:09,1,"I’ve never done a blind reading before, only ever looked at my own chart and some of my close friends and family. This seems fun! I’m going to write my response before reading any of the other comments. I’m new to reading charts so I fully expect to misinterpret a lot of things. Any feedback would be appreciated! :) (Also I prefer reading whole-sign houses so that’s what I did here.)

1. What is the native known for?

Looking at sun, moon, AC (and knowing that it’s a celebrity chart) I get the sense that this person could be a few different things. The moon conjunct MC opposing the sun makes me think of a major leader in some way (political, or maybe a CEO of an influential company) that made or is making big changes in their field. Another impression I get is that they could be a comedian, using the struggles shown in their chart in the jokes they write. 


2. What family dynamics do you see in the chart?

Sun moon opposition might suggest tension between parents or they grew up with a single parent. Sun is in 3rd house of siblings so I wonder if they felt like they were raised by an older sibling (or that they had to be the one to raise their younger sibling(s). 

Venus and Jupiter in cancer make me think this person has or wants to have a big family of their own (Venus ruling 5th house of children). The Saturn Venus opposition there is obviously important but I’m not sure what to make of it exactly. Maybe that their career and ambition got in the way of them starting that family they always wanted, or just that they needed to learn to find that balance first before they could start a family of their own. 

AC ruler is Mercury in 4th whole-sign house, so I think that this person’s family is a major part of their identity- whether that’s the family they grew up in or the one that they started. 


3. What hobbies do you see in the natives chart?

Hmm this is tough. 5th whole-sign house is Libra, so I could see something involving interior design or home decorating since it’s ruled by cancer. Since mercury is a big influence in their chart though, I could see something like poetry or creative writing. I also see a grand trine in the earth signs which probably suggests something they’re good at, but I’m not sure what. Rock climbing? 😋

4. What are a few personality traits of the native?

I definitely get charismatic, well spoken, and intellectual vibes from this person from their big 3.

Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all in the 8th whole-sign house of Capricorn make me wonder if this person deals with and is shaped by a lot of loss in their life. I thiiiink the last time these planets were so close together in Capricorn before Covid was around the 80s (AIDS epidemic) so I’m guessing this person is in their 40s?

The 8th house has something to do with secrets, and with so much retrograde going on there and Saturn opposing Venus, I wonder if there is/was something about this person that they struggled with, something that goes against their values. (Or maybe that had some kind of financial impact on them.)

Grand cross in fixed signs also makes me think of an internal struggle and a reluctance to think about it or address it. They probably have a tendency to bottle up their feelings and explode when they can’t handle it anymore. 


Okay that took me awhile lol. Whether or not any of what I said is correct, it was fun looking at a new chart with specific questions! And if anyone sees ways in which I interpreted something wrong, I’d love to know."
y6ahpc,it9ghch,WishThinker,2022-10-21 22:24:10,1,"**What is the native known for?** as far as celebrity? I'd say this person is a judge lol.

  
**What family dynamics can you see in the chart?** I think native's parents split up under 7 years of age or maybe 11/12 latest. I believe father was involved in or died in some large debts, however mother was very nurturing even though she could be ""a little much"". native has no siblings and no children.  
  
**What hobbies do you see in the chart?** native rides horses :)   
  
**What are a few personality traits of the native?** I think the native is a little known for drama haha. They are always rouletting through philosophies and states of mind / personalities, but through all of it the life they are living is pretty stable and grounded. They may feel a little powerless even if others consider them quite privileged. I'd say they are also known for being able to cut all ties when needed, and maybe to reinvent themself after regular, intense periods of seclusion.

\--

I say judge because 9th and 10th are aquarius and pisces so this person is concerned with the collective in their higher learning and career, and the sun in leo makes me think they stand alone in their career. very quick and active mind from mercury in his sign and gem rising, and sag on descendant I just get the vibe this person is always seeking justice and new ways to better the collective while using their brains and position to do so

I say parents split by 7 because I think it would've happened at or before birth since saturn opposition to cancer, or 7years because the 6th house would have been profected and mars is in direct relationship to it- snip snip. by 12 because at 11 years old native would have entered a taurus profection year which houses mars, planet of cutting and separation. I say dad died in debt from 8th house and mom was nurturing (venus, in cancer) but a little much (jupiter exalted in cancer)

I say horses because mars, planet of activity, in 12th house of large animals. I'd say hunting if it was a day chart and mars was the malefic contrary to sect, but since he is in favour I think it's more active and less stabby. but could be hunting too.

I say drama because of the gem rising square mercury in virgo, sun in leo, moon in 9th house. So that on the surface a person with the gift of gab, square to the chart ruler so its like more aspects of self are always just showing up, sun in leo can be the all important ego, and moon in 9th would be a constant shifting of the relationship to the 9th house aka philosophy and world view. Besides all the vacillation between the moon and mercury, the mercury set up is quite nice, so is the sun in leo, so I think regardless of the mental shifts and epiphanies, the natives life is pretty static and stable. I would say they feel stuck even though viewed as privileged because so many planets are in exaltation- so many aspects of the self may feel like they have to be On Best Behaviour and grateful, and may not feel like they are at liberty to really use the power they so obviously have. I say the bit about cutting ties and reinventing because mars, planet of separation, is the malefic in favour of the sect, so I think he inspires a lot of good action in that house that becomes very constructive

thanks for posting!"
y6ahpc,ita45e8,Waitswitheyes,2022-10-22 01:32:06,1,"Immediate thoughts/striking elements of the chart: 1) native was born in and around eclipse season due to position of sun/moon to nodes, this lends an air of crisis or sudden/unexpected/fated changes that native will encounter throughout their lives, especially at times of heavy transits to these chart points (such as recent Saturn transit in Aquarius perhaps.) 2) Moon/North node so close to MC - recent Saturn in Aquarius transit has hit that point, some sort of public crisis or reckoning for past personal/familial actions potentially 2) the heavy emphasis on the 6/12 house axis - both 'unfortunate' or 'dark' houses - with placement of malefics Mars/Pluto there in strong opposition points to issues potentially of violence, power (imbalances,) control, conflict, physical/mental illness, isolation, confinement, servitude etc 3) the Scorpio/Taurus eclipses this year have been hitting this axis and their natal Mars/Pluto opposition - another potential recent crisis point 4) Native is still quite young, only having recently experienced Saturn return around 2019/2020 (again another recent crisis point potentially) 5) Uranus transit in Taurus (squaring transit Saturn in Aqua) has been hitting their 12th house Mars and triggering their Mars/Pluto opposition as well

My guess is that the native has had a particularly rough few years with all this going on (haven’t we all though?)  - and I hope they're OK?

1. What is the native known for? Please feel free to get detailed here

Big 3 – Gemini AC, Sun in Leo in 3rd, Moon in Aqua in 9th

Chart ruler is Mercury in Virgo in 4th – having chart ruler (in domicile) in 4th house emphasises family, home and roots as major life themes for native. Also to me emphasises strong themes of communication and service to others drawing from what native has learned or been exposed to in family of origin/from ancestors

Sun in Leo very close to the IC – I don’t know – I think this adds more to the strong theme of family inheritance in this chart (see also Moon and Saturn.) Native being born into a prominent or well-known family possibly in entertainment industry, performers, creative, even royalty?

MC in Aquarius ruled by Saturn Rx in Capricorn in the 9th – again ruler of MC is in domicile, 9th house themes have a strong emphasis on native’s public persona, perception, reputation (higher learning, spirituality/religion, publishing, foreigners or foreign travel, philosophy, law.) With emphasis again on Air element here – themes of communication, knowledge, the Aquarius impulse to be the bearer/disseminator of received wisdom for the benefit of humanity

Interesting that Moon in Aqua is prominent here in relation to MC (if we take moon as representing mother in chart) – pointing potentially to mothers’ heavy influence on native’s choice of career/occupation and how they are perceived publicly. Moon in Aqua points to a potentially unconventional or eccentric mother. Perhaps a mother who was well known or a celebrity herself

Father is also prominent here potentially if represented by Saturn as ruler of MC – although Saturn Rx points to everything not being entirely as it seems in terms of father I think – “something is off” with him or his legacy (or his ancestors’ legacy)

In terms of what native is known for – I’m getting strong influencer or “Kardashian” vibes to be honest. Someone who was born into a prominent or influential family and possibly a family of immigrants – where native currently lives possibly isn’t where their family originated from. Native is using this family legacy in some way to create their own livelihood for themselves – not necessarily earning their influence or prominence through their own work but being born into it and capitalising from it. I’m thinking possibly a YouTuber/TikToker/Instagrammer. With 2nd/6th/10th house featuring a lot of Water element as well and with Venus/Jupiter in Cancer in the 3rd playing a prominent role in the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 10th, 11th and 12th houses – something to do with creativity, the arts, wellness industry, nutrition, spirituality, home décor or design or furnishings, maybe even psychology……maybe something like Gwyneth Paltrow and her “Goop” empire perhaps

2.	What family dynamics can you see in the chart?

Mother and father I kinda answered in Q1. 3rd house represents siblings and with Venus and Jupiter there (in Cancer) the possibility that native has siblings and supportive/beneficial relationships with them – although with the strong opposition from Saturn to these placements – points to issues with fathers' actions potentially having a negative impact on native and siblings? A stern, strict, Saturnian father who was prominent in native’s life – but he is not all that he seems on the outside (Saturn Rx.) Potentially a foreign father?

3.	What hobbies do you see in the chart? There's a specific hobby that's a part of the native's life.

A straightforward interpretation would look at 5th house, it’s ruler and rulers’ condition and aspects. 5th house cusp in Virgo, ruled by Mercury in Virgo. Mercury very strong in native’s chart and receives only positive aspects from other planets (trines from Mars and Uranus/Neptune)– no oppositions or squares. Mercury ruling AC points to native possibly turning their hobby into what they are known for publicly? With this strong emphasis on Virgo – again hobbies to do with health, wellness, fitness even? Arts and crafts – with emphasis on arts and crafts to improve and beautify the home or improve health? Perhaps even cooking - a celebrity home chef. Whatever it is – they communicate and share their passion for it widely I think and became an influencer to others because of it.

4.	What are a few personality traits of the native?

I see the native as someone who is driven by genuinely wanting to do good and help and serve others – they want to do this by sharing their wisdom, knowledge, ideas with the world and they truly believe they have a lot to offer in this regard (Gemini AC, Mercury in Virgo, Aquarius MC, Leo Sun.) However - native has a family legacy of things that their family has done that have been not so great somehow that perhaps have recently come to light (Saturn transits to natal planets and angles, Mars/Pluto opposition in the 6th and 12th and recent eclipses in those houses, Uranus transit in the 12th) -  they have to somehow overcome this and how this has affected the way the public sees them, something scandalous  or taboo potentially (Pluto.) This is probably extremely far-fetched, but perhaps family has a history of owning slaves and native is someone that espouses equality, social causes, anti-racism using their social media platform?

Edit: further considering some aspects - the squares between Sun, Mars, Moon, Pluto - abuse of some sort, perhaps within family, possibly sexual"
y6ahpc,itkjefk,Inner_Compass_,2022-10-24 09:49:09,1,"(1) Uranus as MC ruler in 8th House, NN ruler in 8th, Mars/Pluto square MC. This person has an association with death. This could mean a profession related to death (e.g., medium) or they perpetuate death (e.g., solider or provides medical assisted death), they’ve had an NDE, they’ve experienced a lot of death in their life, or they will be a “victim of death” as axis can also speak of external forces coming towards a person. Could be something simple like they’re an actor who plays characters with a lot of “dark” themes. Either way Death is what they’re known for…sounds odd, but that’s the theme I see and it’s major.

Even the chart ruler is involved in the “death theme.” Mercury quincunx MC, Mercury aspecting Uranus/Neptune in 8th, Mars/Pluto although these are soft aspects. 

Random aside, I’ve begun studying how a person’s death manifests in the chart and I’ve so far noticed a Saturn, 6th & 8th House pattern. I’ve found people who die unexpectedly or death is a theme in their life have many outer planets or malefics in the 8th aspecting certain planets. Although this isn’t definitive and still requires extensive study. This person on a surface level fits the “profile.” 


(2) The parents are very different. Or the typical gender “roles” are reversed in the family. Traits normally associated with a father figure are embodied by the mother and vice versa. For example, the mother was disciplinarian. 

The mother influenced the career. There are many hard aspects to the Moon which could allude to a difficult relationship with the mother. The mother as domineering and controlling.

(3) The career is the hobby. The career is a niche (Uranus as MC ruler). Venus/SN in 3rd, Mercury in 5th: Actor (voice work)? Broadway? Communication as a talent. A stage, I hear that in my mind. 

The fixed cross in 4x10 & 6x12 is interesting. The houses combined point towards a past-life theme. The material (6x10) vs. the immaterial (4x12). I would like to see this person’s draconic chart.

Can’t you tell by my non-sensical writing I’m Mercurial? 🙃"

I also read in whole sign, so its a good way to examine the chart. 1) I get your thought process, but not hitting the nail on the head. Hint: its a specific situation the native was known for 2) definitely more on track with this one. Just a tip to never forget aspects though! The aspects to mercury would definitely be important here as well. I would say the sibling part would be somewhat incorrect. You could also look at the sun and moon for the mother and father relationships respectively. Or look at the 4th and 10th house rulers for parents, but there's some controversy about which house rules which parent. 3) again I like the though process, but look at aspects to venus too! That would help with being more concise 4) you are definitely on the right track with personality except for the reserved part."

y6ahpc,it10aq3,Anomenly,2022-10-20 03:35:06,1,"Alrighty gonna give this another go. Thanks for the feedback.

1 - The angular moon as ruler of the 2nd whole sign house conjunct north node makes me think that some sort of massive change in wealth is a big part of their public story - I would guess big gains since they're a celebrity? From a family inheritance and/or business deal? Major ups and downs?

Looking at retrograde Saturn in Capricorn as ruler of the MC and tying 8th house + 9th house topics....

Some sort of incident/accident/legal issue when they were travelling or experiencing altered mind states?

2 - Looking at the sun conjunct the south node and squaring Mars/Pluto, the sun being a general ""father"" signifcator and a sibling significator in this case as it rules the 3rd whole sign house of siblings... An early separation from a father figure? And/or some sort of early disruption with a sibling. Maybe this person had put some work in to raise/support their sibling(s), perhaps unwillingly at first. Looks like a tough situation.

3 - Looking at Venus, ruler of the 5th whole sign house of hobbies*,* she's opposite Saturn almost exactly. My next guesses are: tattooing? graffiti art? Some sort of ""fine art"" altered for the ""common folk.""

4 - I'll leave the personality as is and wait and see.

Thanks for the practice!"
y6ahpc,iswmwbx,geophagustapajos,2022-10-19 06:20:07,2,"A specific situation? Oh intriguing! Okay! I'll look at Mars closer.

I'm reluctant to focus on that Pluto aspect. I prefer to get most of my reading from the personal planets. It is loud here though. Mars is actually aspecting every planet in the entire nativity, if not by degree then by sign. There's a square between the 3-6-9-12 axis and what I've been calling the ""death triangle"" (several friends with transiting Mars and Saturn are in this situation) 4-8-12. You have tight orbs for sextiles here, there are loose ones between Mars-Venus and Saturn-Pluto for example. Adding those in we have additional rectangle between 2-6-8-12.

I'm dying of curiosity how cosmetics plays into this, I don't know if I'll even attempt to figure it out. I'll just try to stick to how things look.

Alright my intuition won't let up about issues with employees or subordinates. There's some power play at hand. The Mars doesn't feel like the cause but the situation. Mars isn't the chart ruler or ruler of the sun/moon. I think Mars is being done towards the native. 

With the moon right on the MC that feels like the strongest significator of self and it's the sect light. The ruler of the moon being Saturn in the eighth sucks tbh. It's staring down that Venus pretty intensely. It's cold and controlling on such an otherwise soft Venusian placement (triplicity ruler). I love Cancer Venuses but this is very let's trap it in a cage and make it perform. Let's drill this well and suck out the value from it. 

Aquarius moons can be quite intense and single minded about their desires and this Saturn stranglehold on Venus feels like we're doing this thing my way or the highway. Everything is very resource focused and I could see that causing some major issues. I'm imagining someone who thinks they're hot shit but is a nightmare to work for and some expose comes about how they treated their workers and the public gets upset. Lawsuits for sure are a possibility. 

The Venus Jupiter second is really that buffering ""no matter how you persecute me ultimately I'll be fine"" annoying feeling though. Yes I'm jealous. 

With all the other aspects the intrigue and difficulties could come from siblings and family esp in regards to inheritance maybe. I really hate 4-8-12 trine. It's very deadly and it includes both the chart ruler/ruler of fourth and both malefics, Mars being the malefic of sect but in bad dignity so he's an angery boi. It could be death/inheritance or issues with the yucky parts of 12/8, mental health or substance abuse issues, jail, lawsuits, illness, accidents, murder, hospitals, rehab. For the native and/or the native's family. 

Just thought of the possibility of this person being a writer. JK Rowling is an Aquarius rising, Leo sun, Virgo mercury, with Mars in bad dignity in Libra. I'm not sure why I am reluctant to mark this native as a writer but they technically could be. Like JKR they got themselves in trouble but this native seems to be in worse trouble than just Twitter cancelled. 

This was very long and rambly! I can't sleep so I don't know how much of this is understandable! I'm really enjoying exploring this chart it's very complex, good choice!"

y6ahpc,itltpk9,Resident_Scholar_677,2022-10-24 16:25:56,1,Right! Smh
y6ahpc,it110n0,Anomenly,2022-10-20 03:41:38,1,Oh for hobbies - maybe piercings or body mod. Noticed Venus is conjunct Chiron.
y6ahpc,it6gddr,Curious-Can4908,2022-10-21 07:47:02,1,"1) There was a massive change and incident. Starting to tie in with 8th/9th house topics and saturn, but still not quite correct with answering. 2) yes for early sibling disruption 3) on the right track with venus saturn aspect, but still not correct. Great job. I get your thought process. This is one where the aspects really matter and tying the whole chart together."
y6ahpc,it2yawr,Curious-Can4908,2022-10-20 15:36:22,2,"Definitely getting close. More on point with mars being done to them. You have a really good sense of the chart. If you want to keep going and try to get more concise, feel free :)"
y6ahpc,isxdu8y,swaon_dav,2022-10-19 12:13:45,2,"I doubt the time is absolutely correct, since 0""33 degree is not very common. Do they look like rising Gemini or Taurus, based on your assessment, I'll do my reading based on it. You know the native."
y6ahpc,itl0nef,Curious-Can4908,2022-10-24 12:58:21,1,It won't let me edit the post. Only gives me the option to save it or delete it.
y6ahpc,itb2gcc,Curious-Can4908,2022-10-22 07:34:17,2,"No problem lol. You have a good sense of reading. It's a great chart to learn from :) I forgot to add as well, feel free to keep going if you want to delve further/give it another shot!"
y6ahpc,ita89ch,Anomenly,2022-10-22 02:05:19,1,"A massive change and incident... renouncing faith/religion maybe, renouncing cultural tradition/relative societal norm? Using a loss/betrayal/controversy to their advantage? There's gotta be some wordplay involved too with that Virgo Mercury ASC ruler.

Saturn, retrograde in Capricorn in the 9th Placidus house, rules the 8th/9th houses and 9th house MC, is opposite the ruler of the 5th/12th houses, is square the ruler of the 11th/6th houses, and square the 6th house Pluto... that's half the chart, haha. This is so hard, but I feel like it's going to be so obvious once the celebrity is revealed 😄"
y6ahpc,it8psqa,geophagustapajos,2022-10-21 19:17:50,6,"Okay. I've been looking and thinking more about this chart plus your hints. This is a really wild guess but could there be something cult or religious oppression related here? The Saturn pressing down on the Venus and Jupiter, like an oppressive but philosophical driven control from the 8th. The focus on 3/9 could be education related, someone who wanted freedom to learn? The Mars persecuting from the community or even having bad health/accidents. I hope this person wasn't murdered/committed suicide but... The recent Saturn return and then there was the Mars return recently plus eclipses across the first and seventh wouldn't be gentle."
y6ahpc,isxfie6,Curious-Can4908,2022-10-19 12:29:05,2,"Not common doesn't mean it doesn't happen. At some point, you gotta trust the chart. In the end, you never truly know whats accurate unless you were there. I'd go with gemini and the chart that's presented :)"
y6ahpc,itl3qig,swaon_dav,2022-10-24 13:23:36,1,Maybe you can check with the mod about it. That's unusual?
y6ahpc,itbz2jg,Waitswitheyes,2022-10-22 14:02:08,1,"I'm still not able to pinpoint the hobby or what native was known for. But I think that looking at the Sun/Moon/Pluto/Mars oppositions and squares - all in fixed signs and all being triggered off by recent hard Uranus and Saturn transits through them, as well as the 6/12 house themes being prominent - native has harmed someone or has harm done to them and obviously whatever went down was quite public, some sort of crisis. Perhaps tied to the family dynamics and upbringing they received shaping their psychology in some way - both parents being unsupportive or more focussed on their own marital strife than being there for their child, possibly abuse. The legal system (Saturn) involved."
y6ahpc,itb1osb,Curious-Can4908,2022-10-22 07:23:47,1,"Still not quite nailing it lol. You gave it a good shot though. 

I feel like everyone is getting so confounded with the squares. Sometimes even not getting so confused necessarily with the house placements...what do you think a grand cross with moon, sun, mars and pluto is like for a native psychologically? Then ask yourself ...if these represent external events as well, what kind of external events would trigger this kind of psychology? Then when you've delved into that deeply and have a good feeling of it, try to add in the houses. There's other layers but start there. Same for the grand trine here. 

In this way, we can not get overwhelmed with the chart, the heart and soul of the chart is felt even if you get the details wrong, and we are respecting how interconnected everything is. Such is astrology. And such is life. 

My bad for the soliloquy, but hope this helps. I'm getting a reputation on reddit for this 🤣"

yxinlp,iwqlczf,shkico,2022-11-17 16:46:59,9,"I think this is a great way to practice although I feel like it is a bit for more advanced users. Not related to this type of practicum, I would suggest one more way of practicing together in community. How about we know who is the person and from reading up on his biography we try to figure out the cause behind his work, his success/failure, character traits, social relations etc? This approach seems more open to people with less astrological background, it would be easier to look for clues and with a little bit of information here and there we could learn more. What do you think? This practicum could also be weekly and in parallel published with this one"
yxinlp,ixidi8p,minnie_van_driver,2022-11-23 17:46:52,3,"I’ve not tried this before and I’m coming to it a little late, so my thoughts on this chart are also influenced by the reposes other people have gotten. 

Saturn in its domicile in the 1st house in Aquarius and the moon in Capricorn in a night chart is some major Saturn energy.  I think the native’s personality is serious or even dour, but also a bit counter culture and maybe feeling at odds with society in a way that is “society’s fault” like the rest of the world hast caught up to them yet. 

They are known for something that requires work and discipline, but also for being ground breaking this this field.  Maybe activism, but an activist that is known for doing the work, not necessarily the spokesperson for a movement. With Venus is the 1st house, I also think maybe known for doing something that people connect to  on an artistic level. Maybe a musician- an art that requires a lot of diligence and discipline to master. The moon in Capricorn makes me this that the native’s mother was instrumental in enforcing this disciplined approach, but the moon is in a close trine with Jupiter, so I’m thinking it was in an encouraging way that benefited the native.

The Jupiter/Mars conjunction in the 8th whole sign house of shared/inherited resources is interesting.  I’m thinking there is something that is both their greatest asset and their greatest challenge here. Maybe a member of an oppressed minority with a cultural inheritance that shaped their success, maybe a familial inheritance that was objectively beneficial but also very challenging/frustrating/upsetting. 

Someone else mentioned Pluto in Cancer putting the native in the an historical context l impacted by WWI and its aftermath, the Great Depression, the age of empire and the formal if not actually dissolution of empires, civil rights movement, the computer age, etc.  I think the native was in some way on the leading edge of some aspect of the societal change that happened in the last century.  I’m leaning towards it being in the realm of art and or human rights."
yxinlp,iwv2j7u,lowproblem_3151,2022-11-18 15:57:56,2,"The native seems to me to have had a life with challenges, but they weren't family or financial related. Maybe struggled to be known for what the wanted to be known for? with Saturn and Venus rising, that indicates a struggle with oneself, but also one who values themselves. 

My guess is that they were known for communication, as indicated by Chiron in the third house sextike Pluto and trine Virgo Stellium. Again, they did struggle to be known with Chiron square sun

The native has Pluto in cancer, which likely means that WWII touched them in some way. They could have been in teenage/early twenties when the war was happening. With Pluto opposing the moon in Capricorn, they could have lost their father in the war, or just became cold emotionally due to the trauma they were seeing. This is a net negative aspect, to me, though it can be used to fuel their life purpose, especially w Pluto trine Pisces Stellium 

Virgo Stellium and Pisces Stellium propelled them to work hard and perfect their craft, and to create transformation (MC In Scorpio) In their life. They can experience the good and bad of both signs through this opposition. If they managed to learn to handle their perfectionism, they will have achieved a lot of their souls purpose (n node in Pisces trine mc)

It is possible that the native also revolutionized sports via the way they valued them (Uranus in Aries in second house) especially considering any early experiences they had with sports in early childhood. 

I do not have any similar placements to this person. Are charts are wildly different. I have an Aquarius Stellium, so we both had strong Aquarius feelings. They have the traditional ruler rising, and I have the modern ruler in the 4rh house (I could go on about my childhood trauma lol). 

Overall this person seems to have had a successful life, but maybe not one of ease or happiness."
yxinlp,ixbc6vc,schwaschwaschwaschwa,2022-11-22 03:57:30,2,"Was this person a prisoner at some stage? Or, dealing with that type of situation?

My usual approach is to look at the planets connecting to the angles by degree, for this there is Saturn and the Moon in H12, the joy and domicile of Saturn.

It seems like there is a degree of Saturnian challenge here, perhaps in connection to origins or country because of Venus being with Saturn and ruling the fourth house.

This could be many things but Saturn can bring matters of serious concern, sorrow and grief, confinement, etc.

Maybe the person is or was a farmer at one point? Saturn also tends to the land, another fourth house and lunar type of deal.

Checking out Mars's position, because it rules the Mc, I'm not sure I can untangle what's going on there, kind of an interesting arrangement but I'm not at all practised in prediction. Possibly they were somewhat known for possessing a degree of technical skill or specialist knowledge?

In terms of how this person was, I am guessing that they tended towards the melancholic humoral temperament, with a tendency towards severity, graveness, deep contemplation, a sense of duty, and a degree of pessimism or darkness."

yxinlp,iws0720,ZodiacDax,2022-11-17 22:24:01,2,I think that's a good idea. No reason we can't do both kinds of practicums. Just need to name this one something different.

* Accurate description of native's personality - serious but also counter culture at same  time,  a lot of misfortune she endured was society's fault (some of it from other sources) 
* Native was an activist but not as prominent a spokesperson for the movement as others' were at the time - and activism was not their 'main mode' of being so to speak
* Native was definitely a celebrated and talented artist (musician) and mother was instrumental in her career establishment in many many ways 
* Native was a member of an oppressed minority with a cultural inheritance (music) that shaped their success
* Native was certainly at the leading edge of human and civil rights movements in their country of origin

Really well done - congratulations!"
yxinlp,iwwoean,Waitswitheyes,2022-11-18 22:34:45,2,"You are definitely on the right track with a number of things for native!

* Definitely had a life of challenges - with oneself, what they wanted to be known for....but beyond that as well
* They were known for communication of a particular type....
* WW2 was not the 'struggle' or 'fight' that marked their life in the most profound way, but the native was involved in a wider societal struggle of the time - there was definitely trauma involved
* They absolutely worked hard to perfect their craft and create transformation
* Native was not involved in sports at all sadly!
* They certainly were successful but certainly not a life of ease or happiness at various points"
yxinlp,ixc303m,Waitswitheyes,2022-11-22 09:11:33,3,"Hi there, you are certainly on the right track with your interpretation in many ways.

- Person was not a prisoner
- Definitely plenty of challenges faced in country of origin,  especially around the time native was at the pinnacle of their career
- Not a farmer or anything related with farming sadly!
- Definitely known in their field for their skill and craft
- Definitely prone to melancholy, pessimism - was not afraid of getting dark. Interesting you note a sense of duty because in many ways native was kind of duty bound to family and community expectations of them due to their natural talent early on in life."

**""Nov 7-13 Weekly Astro Practicum 5""**"
yhxl3m,iuplyq0,Tudlod,2022-11-02 02:18:01,8,"1. Native is known for being famous for the sake of being famous, and for having a multitude of public, polarizing scandals and miscommunications, if not plagued by rumors. Disconnect between what this person says and how others interpret their words. If I’d have to guess, I’d say they are some sort of home lifestyle guru, or found success from something they do at home..
2. Home life seemed to be intense with a domineering mother, that may have also been a public figure in her own right. Parents may have divorced while still young, and found themselves between households. The shifting dynamics of environments helped inspire success. Probably has one sibling, a sister, who he cares for. Love/hate relationship with mother.
3. The native is probably passive aggressive, and struggles with mental health issues that directly affect their influence and public persona. They are obviously acutely aware of who they are, and of the influential effect they have on other people. Self-obsessed, but self-aware? They are likely to have incredible success at stirring up conversation in the public sphere, and it seems this person thrives in capitalizing on their identity/personal life if that makes sense. Charming, passionate, intense, controlling in regards to creativity and routine, always finding another hill to climb for all to see.
4. The good is that everything else about their chart is in ok territory. Mars in cancer 12 house, and the stellium in the third house/first quarter of the chart seem to be causing the most turbulence. They struggled growing up and having that become a public identity.

That’s my take. I have no clue if I was on the right track."
yhxl3m,ived8nc,pinkoo28,2022-11-07 10:33:17,6,This is a really fun idea and I hope it keeps going. I knew the year this person was born because all of the outer planets were just a little beyond my own chart so I searched for celebrities born one year after me and as soon as I saw them I knew they were the one.I didn't comment because I'm still learning and I'd already worked out who it was. But it's a great way for us to learn how to read other people's charts. Maybe I'll have something small to say on the next one
yhxl3m,iulq8xa,stodolaa,2022-11-01 08:48:09,4,"First time doing this, please be kind as I still feel like a noob 😅 also gonna be using whole house system cause that’s what I been learning with! 

1. MC in Aries is trining their Sun and Mercury, may be good at speaking about certain values regarding self worth, self respect, that Sun being in its domicile it’s comfortable there, with the Mercury it’s like they really want their story/movement to be heard/acknowledged? Like people can benefit from that, fire sign is passionate about wanting to be heard, and put on a good show while doing so. Mars in first house (also being in fall in the sign of Cancer) squaring MC seems like they may be known for some drama, expressing themselves a bit too dramatically sometimes too? I’m gonna suggest some sort of rights activist, maybe even very compassionate, outspoken feminist or something. Maybe family law/domestic abuse activist? Someone who knows they have enough ground to stand on legally speaking but may be playing on peoples heart strings to get their message across (Mars in Cancer) or may be too aggressive with their message to the world (Mercury combust) with maybe somewhat extreme viewpoints considering it’s in 2nd house too. Another random one, with some much libra sextile that Leo sun, it could also be a model. 

2. 4th house is in Libra with all those placements, Saturn exalted in Libra puts emphasis on the importance of justice/fairness/equality or legal system for the natal growing up, however that same Saturn is squaring natal’s mars, that’s two malefics, that’s rebelling against authority, perhaps standing up to a parent figure or familial traditions  for the sake of emotional well-being. Moon being in there could be pointing to mom or mother type of figure/female within family who might’ve been emotionally demanding? Libra can fall victim of people pleasing tendencies in the family, or rather making sure peace is kept and neglecting their own needs. I feel like this person is very enthusiastic and outspoken considering that Mercury trining triple conjunction, they’re all about empowering people through speech, like speaking up on behalf of those who are not able to or don’t have that strength. 

3. Moon is conjunct both Saturn and Jupiter which can create an emotional seesaw, natal may have been good natured yet emotionally vulnerable as a child but that also creates a very hard working natal in adulthood, may not be so obvious since all them planets are so close to IC. Venus in Virgo (in its fall) may be too critical of romantic interests in terms of looking at every single detail, which is trining Mars( who is also in its fall), I feel like the natal may be very picky with their partners and not easy to open up but once they fall, they fall real hard, may not trust people otherwise. Someone who believes in their mission/vocation (Neptune sextile Pluto). Lilith square ascendant makes me think the natal has grown to accept their sexuality (Scorpio in 5th house) or some deep inner child wound that would’ve made it impossible to fully express themselves as an individual in early life, Cancer rising adds a bit of depth to that as coming out of their shell in later life, and overcoming shyness and letting that Leo energy by heard (Mercury). 
4. Not sure how to answer this question, do you mean like the good in terms of strong placements or the good in terms of their personality?"
yhxl3m,iunk03c,swaon_dav,2022-11-01 18:00:43,4,"Finally other Asc then Gemini :) I'm all in for Cancer rising night charts :P I guess the native is a woman, best known for her marriage, family and emotionalism. Moon as ruler of Asc with exalted Saturn, ruler of 7/8 H shows very destined marriage with older partner, who has money, fame and fortune. Maybe he is self made person (Saturn exalted). They both are in 4H of family, property, personal life. Ruler of 4th Mercury is with Sun in Leo in 2d H, showing she comes from rich famous family and has the support of her family. She probably have a younger sister and older brother (Venus in 3d as ruler of 11H + despositor Merc in 11 from Moon). The native is known for their money, voice, speaking and managing family resources. Ruler of 4th in 3d can show a lot of short distance travel related to home plus Venus is sext. ruler of 10th Mars, so trips related to work as well. Family situation would be, she lost one of her parents or lost touch with the mother (Venus in 12 from 4th debilitated). Moon/Saturn are very karmic conjunction and may show separation from one of the parents due divorce or breakup. Pluto and Jupiter in 4th shows she comes from very strict traditional family background, where religion is very pronounced but maybe not in the best way. Sun + Merc in 2d also shows early upbringing and both Saturn and Sun shows the father figure in the native chart, both dignified, showing the father is very prominent in native's life, not necessarily the most beneficial for the person though. Saturn being exalted can show strict and limiting, controlling parent and later partner. Moon in Libra is always trying to compromise for peace and could tolerate a lot of abuse, not knowing how to stand their own ground. Mars in 1st debilitated also shows the unstable and rather suppressed early childhood of taking in all the negatives and bad sides of life and not knowing how to release. North Node with Sun and Mercury shows the native strives for self-reliance and independence and also produce own  resources and trying to break free from their family shadow, so they can establish themselves separately from their family name. Maybe the native is prone to have one marriage with a lot of bumpy rides, sticking to one for what its worth. After all Moon in Libra is very insecure and needs always someone stronger to hold the reins. Mars as ruler of 10th and 5th is very beneficial for Cancer rising and in 1st can produce born public figures, who are best known for their ticking explosive at times outbursts and intensity. The native may be involved with modeling or fashion (cosmetic, beauty) as well, which they could excel and earn money from it (Venus Mercury Sun connection). Lilith and Uranus in 5th shows native's first child could be an early on one, when she was younger (as marriage happened early on as well), quite unusual and not really fitting in the family picture.. The native loves hidden, secret love, passionate and fill with a lot of dramatic if not a bit violent, extreme taste.  North Node in Leo shows clearly how much the native need to focus on themselves, rather other people and public. They may not like the attention right away, though they may not show it. They could feel shy and too private to show anything out there in the open or what is shown is very controlled and selective. The native doesn't like to be exposed as weak and may be quite guarded and learn throughout her life how to be at ease with people in personal level. People like her mostly for her exterior, which is all she manage to keep but with getting older she finds no need to maintain what the public perception of her is no longer and let it out.. or at least learning how to loose it. Neptune in 6th and Jupiter in 4th, maybe she love pets and surround herself with a lot of them at home. Maybe she like birds and dogs. With debilitated Mars in 1st as 10H ruler, it could show good acting skills, especially with Sun in 2d, so whatever comes from her mouth has power to influence. Very articulate and emotional when comes to speaking."
yhxl3m,iv1q8g8,Curious-Can4908,2022-11-04 16:57:22,4,"Hi I use whole sign houses! 👋 

1) With the MC trine sun/mercury/NN in leo in the 2nd house, this could be some kind of speaker, politician, or actor. This person definitely has money and possessions and puts them on display. With the trine to neptune, I'm feeling more of an actor/glamor aspect to them but they could also just be a great story teller or good at putting on a show. Probably a great liar as well. 6th house neptune could be an association to health and wellness and with Sagittarius teaching that to others as a spiritual pursuit. The ruler of the MC being mars in cancer in the 1st square the MC shows that career and identity are intertwined but there's an aspect to the identity that also doesn't fit. In cancer and with the moon opposing mc makes me think children and home life are difficult to keep out of the public eye though they try. They could also be much more passive (mars in cancer) than their public image (MC in aries) presents. The ruler of the MC also ruling the Scorpio 5th house makes me think they could be known for their children in some way, again tying in with the cancer/moon theme. Children would definitely be a transformative and sometimes difgicukt area for the native. Alternately, they could be known for their sex/sex appeal. Or going with the actor theme and 5th house being a house of creation, they would produce content that is dark and edgy (scorpio) and also unique and eccentric (uranus 5th house.)

2) Home life and childhood are probably a mixed bag. That libra stellium in the 4th really wants to keep up an aesthetic appearance and keep things lighthearted, but there's definitely difficulties here. The 4th is ruled by venus which is really positive in a night chart, but unfortunately its in its fall in virgo in the 3rd, which is not a promising placement. Home can be a place of love and nurturing but it's also a place of judgement where the flaws stand out (which they definitely do with moon/saturn/pluto there magnified by jupiter), less than ideal for that libra energy. Venus in virgo in the 3rd will want to escape for weekends away from home to feel more grounded and nourished. In a night chart, saturn is the greater malefic. Here it's in its exaltation in libra in an angular house. Very strong saturn that would make the native committed to their home and family life and children but also feel burdened by it. Native may even feel burdened by the need for constant beauty (libra). Pluto brings transformation and power plays to the mix to the home life, possibly even abuse at times. The moon wants so hard to be happy and light hearted and beautiful but the saturn and pluto energy is so heavy for the moon here. Jupiter is there to both magnify this and smooth it out so its more bearable. The moon is the chart ruler so this is a big part of the life path path of the native to let home transform them and stay committed and find the love and happiness in it all in this area despite the struggle. The square from mars in the 1st to both the IC and MC show the struggle to find their identity through work and home life without also completely losing themselves as well as the struggle between being loving and passive (cancer/libra) vs agressive and self centered (mars/aries). 

I'm honestly too tired to go on and have to get some sleep. I feel I probably touched on all the questions a little. Hopefully not way off base in my tiredness lol. Have a good day."

I imagine this person as a sort of diplomat/negotiator.  especially as the conjunction is in Libra which is a smooth talking diplomatic sign.

yhxl3m,iuknykw,Waitswitheyes,2022-11-01 01:32:36,3,"Sorry - again another really long essay from me.....

Really interesting chart. I'm really tempted to want to use Placidus to interpret it because it would place Mars in Cancer in the 12th - which seems very intriguing in how that could have played out for the native as opposed to it being in the 1st house. Mars above the horizon in a night chart making it's energy as out-of-sect malefic more chaotic or harmful to native than usual (ruling MC for native also) - then the added intrigue of it being in the 12th, hmmmm....points to something subterranean, taboo or scandalous potentially in native's career or native's career not going smoothly due to 12th house themes..... 

.....But have decided am going to use WSH.

1, What the native is known for? and 2. Native’s life story 

It strikes me that most of the native's natal planets are below the horizon (and it is a night chart) meaning their focus in life may be more about themselves and their 'nearest and dearest' rather than focussing their energies on the other, wider community and society. I think this is emphasised also by Mars in Cancer in the 1st (the impulse to fight for and protect self, home and family)  squaring those major 4th house planets in Libra conjunct the IC. I feel that this placement below horizon for the sun would 'dim' or mute the more exuberant and showy aspects of their Leo sun somewhat as well, or channel these aspects into gaining attention for native's agenda (which is focussed on home and family?) 

Really interesting that we see such an emphasis on the 4th house and IC with Moon, Saturn, Jupiter all closely conjunct IC there. Speaks to questions about what the native has inherited from family, roots and ancestors, what they were born into and how they take this into adulthood and their calling in life. With the IC/4th house in Libra - a home and family life that was possibly harmonious, balanced, fair...beauty, art, relationships were valued by parents perhaps. However with Pluto there, and also all those Libra placements being ruled by a Venus in fall in Virgo - perhaps not all is at it seemed from the outside in terms of native's childhood and family, the possibility there of critical, nit-picky or even domineering family/parents with high expectations for the native. Sun in Leo in 2nd as a well-known/high profile father that possibly was materially well-off and expected his children to reflect this and carry on this legacy; Moon in Libra as a mother who was possibly very 'home and family' values oriented, well presented and typically 'feminine' in her role as wife, mother, homemaker - expected the same of her children as reflections of her?

Honestly I see native as someone who was born in a quite well-off, well-to-do and privileged family environment and and as someone who seems very much about promoting and protecting these so-called 'family values' in life in their career/vocation - against what he or she sees as threats to these values (Mars in Cancer.) So potentially someone who is conservative and therefore against the 'progressive' changes we are seeing in current era happening in the sphere of home and family brought about by feminism, the LGBTIQA+ movements etc. Possibly a politician or lawmaker or even religious minister (Jupiter in Libra ruling the 9th house of Pisces) very firmly on the conservative side of life and 'fighting' for these values. A person who could be moody or quick to anger when 'triggered' emotionally by what they perceive as unfairness (to them.) 

Is the native a USA based Republican/conservative judge, politician or minister by any chance? 

3. Native's personality traits

The harmonious sextile aspects between native's Leo Sun/Mercury and Libra Moon conjunct Saturn/Jupiter points to native being able to balance and express the energies of these signs comfortably in their personality - so someone who is warm, possibly generous, more outgoing than they are reserved....as well as someone at least outwardly wanting to be seen as fair, reasoned, balanced in their dealings with others. However, I think that Mars in Cancer plays havoc a bit with this....it may come along and push native into over-zealousness and dogged defence of themselves and their viewpoints and values against evidence to the contrary and make them an emotional arguer rather than a reasoned or dispassionate one. 

4. The good and the bad in the natives' chart

Good - Jupiter/Saturn conjunction in Libra in 4th, exalted Saturn conjunct Jupiter in Libra ruling the 6th,7th, 8th, 9th houses. No negative aspects to Sun/Mercury in Leo at all. 

Bad - Mars in Cancer ruling the 5th and 10th houses and squaring/creating tension and conflict with the 4th house and all the Libra placements there (except Pluto,) including the Moon. Native's impulse to be fair, reasoned, balanced and harmonious in their dealings with others in tension with their impulse to be doggedly protective of themselves, home, family and their values and respond with moodiness and/or aggression when this is threatened. All Libra placements ruled by a Venus in fall - so not able to fully express themselves all that well perhaps. 

Thanks OP for posting the chart!"
yhxl3m,iujqqpm,geophagustapajos,2022-10-31 21:14:49,2,"Okay fun chart! I need more second house as well as Saturn/Jupiter combo practice! I'm not confident here! 😂

1 What the native is known for?

With the Aries MH/10th ruled by Mars in the first, and Mars connected by aspect and the lunar rulership of the first to both Jupiter and Saturn in Libra I feel like there's a military/political/law related. Since it's in the 4th it could be familial but if it is, they associate their identity and persona with it. Mars Cancer can generally be pretty ""defend home/loved ones"" energy, which can be sometimes nationalistic. Sun in Leo gives a sense of wanting to be a leader in such an arena, and in the second house it feels protective in some sense.


2 Native’s life story 

Hard question! Can I get a direction on where you want this to go? Life story can be pages long.

3 Native’s personality traits

Mars in the first house can be spicy if you hit it right. In Cancer it's triggered by threats to their home/family. The Leo sun is assertive, the moon in Libra would normally be a little more conciliatory but it's conjunct Saturn and Jupiter which I think gives it a bit of a ""I am right"" vibe. Justicey and philosophical. The Venus in Virgo is quite selective, and Leo is already particular, so I think this person might have a taste for high quality items (and might be spendy with it lol). 

4 The good / the bad in native’s chart

Good: Sun in Leo with only positive aspects, Saturn in Libra on IC who gets extra boost from the luminary of sect and Jupiter (this is good for Saturn things).

Sun in Leo gives the strength of purpose and mission, accomplishment, confidence, and knowing who oneself is. Connected to the moon, Saturn, and Jupiter it feels like a Grand Purpose and the spirit is in agreement with the life path. Saturn gives that extra hard work ability, and in his exaltation with a benefic and sect light and angular he's what I would call the lord of nativity here. With it ruling their seventh they might have had a slow burn relationship path but eventually a strong partnership. 

Also probably fine financially with the Sun and NN there.

Bad: Mars in Cancer, Mercury combust, moon conjunct Saturn, Venus in Virgo. 

Mars in Cancer in first... I just think Mars in the first is generally temperamental and in its fall can be inconsistent and hard to control in situations. This could also indicate by Lilly standards something wrong with the native's face (or body in my opinion). Acne, scars/burns, inflammatory things. Saturn on the moon gives a secondary vote for some health issues. Jupiter the ruler of the sixth is also conjunct Saturn so a third vote for health issues. Saturn is usually more chronic while Mars is more accidental so idk in a bad case a car wreck that left them with chronic back issues. 

Mercury is combust, hidden under the sun. He rules both the 12th and 3rd. Mercury in could indicate some shady connections or secretive matters the individual was involved in, or hidden enemies, or more bad health issues. 

Venus in Virgo is picky. Ruled by that Mercury, I have the impression of someone who might not be extremely forthcoming and talkative often despite the Leo and Libra planets. Seems a little private and selective. It is the ruler of their friendship house so I think they might keep a small friend group. I'm bad at predicting siblings so I'm not going to try lol."

Maybe if we take the ruler of 4/10 which are Mars and Venus, they have very close applying sextile, which can show they get along, besides their differences (the parents). The final dispositor is Sun in Leo, love for self expression, love to drama and showing off."
yhxl3m,iumzxjw,YungAfrika,2022-11-01 15:52:55,3,"Mars in Cancer in the 12th:  12th house is where things are. hidden away or in a foreign land, out of sight, sequestered in some way or the other.  

It rules 10th house and 5th house.  His/Her public role/office (10th house) and creative world, world of children etc (5th house) will be hidden away.  Again the possibility of a government agent of some sort.  Now I'd think spy or secret agent.  

especially as Mars in Cancer may bring some nationalistic pride and care, or at least for the immediate family and lineage.  

A big thing is that Mars in cancer is in Square aspect to the stellium of Moon, Jupiter and Saturn.  That is Big!  It'll be a theme.  This is a 3rd house (full of gab, communication) tension with 12th (hidden, secrets, sequestration).  

Immediately I think of Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden or some such whistleblower.  However it wasn't them when I checked.  This person will struggle to keep the secrets required by Mars in 12th.  Mars, the ruler of their public office and creative activities will require discretion and secrecy.  Yet the 3rd house stellium will make that difficult cause they love to talk and share information.  

The moon is applying to the square, so it is herself (1st house), and her natural tendency for protection of family and inner circle (cancer) that as her life proceeds will come more and more into conflict with this need for secrecy.  

Jupiter and Saturn squares to Mars are easing.  Her 6th, 7th, 8th and9th house affairs will also come into conflict with this need for secrecy and being hidden away.  though with less intensity than it occurs with the moon.  

I also notice they were born in eclipse season.  A few days after a solar eclipse it seems.  I dunno what the significance of this is.  North nodes dim the Sun,  They could be revolutionaries of some sort. or overshadow Authority figures.  However it occurs in Leo so I don't know if that means the Sun though eclipsed remains strong.  

&#x200B;

Definitely a flamboyant person as Leo rules 2nd house which will tell us about their tastes and what they would spend money on.  Their tastes will be very showy, flamboyant.  and with Sun in the first house it will be very important to indulge it."

These practices have been really helpful to me for being able to test these kinds of advice.

With the Saturn/Jupiter on the IC it feels like...idk royal or wealthy and powerful family maybe. Not sure this person ever was a figurehead but in a lot of royals at least there's the Leo planet and significant Saturn placement. The moon there could mean it's extremely important to the individual, and Jupiter meaning it could be also large. Power, wealth, numerous... With the Venus ruling the fourth though in fall there's a high standard to be met, rules, standards to be in good graces. It feels like while it was an important part of the native's life, it wasn't a cakewalk. And with the extra add on subterfuge Mercury it kinda feels like a somewhat Game of Thrones situation. I kinda keep veering in my head between the extremes of a Kardashian type family and then The Godfather lol. I could be way off again.

I got my supervisors a card with a hand-written note and a mug. I don’t want to come across as being ungrateful and entitled. They take the time to take you under their wing and I’m grateful for that. 

I think I started having these thoughts due to social media."
yy67fs,iwtd7q6,CurrencyFearless250,2022-11-18 04:55:54,1,I’m not sure how common it is for students to get gifts. A few girls I know in my program got something from one of their supervisors. I’ve made a general rule of thumb to get a card for a supervisor (work or grad school) if I developed a good relationship with them. Not everyone is a gift-giver and that’s fine

Fwiw I left social media in 2018 and was terrified I’d “lose” important people in my life, but in the years since, I can honestly say I haven’t lost anyone I’d miss due to that choice. I still hang out here and have a LinkedIn and researchgate, but I don’t actively “engage” in those places. I engage with people I actually know by phone or I see them."

I’m in my first LTO and I had no idea how to enter marks or even calculate them. I asked another teacher to help and I figured it out, but it is something I wish I knew or at least had a general idea about. If you don’t end up working in the same board it may not be the most helpful, but something to consider. Also parents. As a teacher candidate I had no communication with parents. We somewhat talked about it, but it is definitely something I would have liked to ask more about.

I feel bad saying this though because she was very nice to me (and I've heard horror stories from peers about being paired with someone who wasn't nice at all.)  And a long time ago, was probably a pretty good teacher.  But people get up there in their years and get tired and don't want to keep up, I get it."

I went in the next day and confronted him. I was pissed, and got my university practicum coordinator and a practicum consultant involved."
zjm7a1,izvq0mg,DisillusionedReader,2022-12-12 04:50:35,5,Incorporate regularly asking for feedback from clients as part of sessions - there will be clients who may not share/divulge their thoughts but there will be those that will. Regularly do this and you will get a lot of information to use and will be able to figure out how to course correct if needed.

zjm7a1,izvq3e0,admsun,2022-12-12 04:51:19,1,Hi!! I’m at the end of my internship/Prac so I was recently in your shoes. It’s normal to be anxious or scared or fearful about the whole experience. It was all of our first times ever counseling real people. It’s likely you’ll shadow some others at your site once you get through your training and they will not just let you see people your first week (I started in Jan and started seeing a couple clients mid-March?). It will get better and easier with time and you will feel more able to roll with the punches once it gets started! Try to remember why you got into the field and what is driving you to want to do this work. Best of luck and I hope you have an awesome experience 🧡
zjm7a1,izwvtz7,cakesandkittens,2022-12-12 13:23:06,1,"As others have mentioned, it’s so normal to feel nervous and out of your depth. Person centered and CBT are a good place to start depending on the site/ages served. There are lots of CBT resource ideas online for free. As a student, you should also have access to tons of free trainings in your university library. Alexander Street Press is a site that has tons of psych/counseling trainings on it. Pschotherapy.net is another one though most of their content is really dated."
zne3r0,j0gcqzt,The1SatanFears,2022-12-16 13:13:27,7,"I would say the ED would be a good place for the practicum because you’d likely get the opportunity to practice a bunch of skills, like IV starts, foley placement, NG tubes, etc. You’d also get to see a bunch of codes and initiating of titratable drugs, vents, etc. which you’ll see a lot of in the ICU."

zne3r0,j0ivyoj,FreshCockroach321,2022-12-16 23:46:39,1,"Assuming it's one that sees some action, I'd say ED. You will be far more likely to encounter critical care patients, help with codes, observe central line placements, bedside procedures, etc there. There is significantly more opportunities to try IVs and lab draws. 

ED also provides a bigger variety of patients and diseases, as PCUs are usually specialized, which I think is helpful as you figure out what type of ICU you might want to go to. And considering the number of patients that come up to the ICU from the ED, knowing how the unit works and the challenges will help you work better with them when you are on the other side."
zne3r0,j0i241o,mntn_mermaid,2022-12-16 20:13:11,1,Can you elaborate on how I can properly gauge the acuity of the PCU?
zne3r0,j0i33ct,nopassgaszone,2022-12-16 20:19:50,2,"Find out about the patients and nursing care. Some PCUs are straight up telemetry floors - others are literally sub-ICUs (or a *step down* from ICU). 

Like, are there titratable drips? What kind? Vents? Chest tubes? Pacemakers (transvenous or epicardial)? So on and so forth."

This is one of those times. You can find someone attractive, acknowledge it, and move on. It’s not a problem to be solved, it’s a reality of being human. You focus on other things.

If you’re in practicum, I’d imagine you have other, more pressing matters to put your full attention to, ie, developing professional skills, seeing your clients, getting supervision."

I will now talk about co-workers. Clients is not addressed below due to it not being appropriate…

Your reputation is your livelihood - protect it by making smart, thought out decisions. Some people make “pre-decisions” or boundaries such as not dating co-workers. In my opinion, and I can only speak for myself, I think this is really smart and avoids a lot of office drama and helps maintain focus. Some people at my work have dated and are now happily married, it can certainly work. 

I’d just acknowledge the feeling in yourself and to yourself (hey I’m feeling attracted to this person right now) and let it pass. If it is persistent, it’s something to talk through with your therapist, your support system, and if you start dating, your supervisor / HR."

I think you’d greatly benefit from having a dedicated therapist to unpack some feelings about women generally. 

There are attractive people in the world, but recognizing that someone is attractive in passing is different than being attracted to them in a clinical setting (coworker or patient). Please speak with your therapist about navigating these feelings."

2. Attraction doesn’t mean you will act on it 
3. Attraction intensity tapers and wear off  just like with any honeymoon period so wait it out? And carry on as you mentioned above.
4. In any workplace they discourage relationship due to what happens after the fall out but it happens you just have to make it office and sign waiver and this will be up to the workplace policy. Err on the safety side just say no to workplace romance.

I mean, if you're attracted to a number of your coworkers, don't be reckless about it. But if there is a genuine connection with someone, what's the problem? Are there rules about not dating coworkers? I'm sorry, I have not worked in many group environments. I'm confused about whether this is a norm in any group work environment, or especially in the therapy field? Therapy is a rather solitary practice anyway, unless you are facilitating collaborative group work with a colleague. I mean, it'd be inappropriate to pursue a supervisor or course. But, a peer? As long as it doesn't interfere with your professional duties, which is to your clients and your own learning, I don't understand the issue."

OP also didn’t describe an interest or connection to one person. They didn’t even say anything about these coworkers personalities, interests, etc. just that they’re physically attracted.

I don't mean to come off too harsh, but it seriously seems like you're telling this person to just disconnect from their feelings rather than understand them.

x8lupa,inje8hv,MDisch,2022-09-08 02:30:38,34,"Oh it’s in writing in most workplaces, especially in relation to your role and power dynamics - you can have a relationship with a co-worker, but not a supervisor/ boss or subordinate.

I feel feelings of attraction all the time at work, I think everyone does! I think the more you work with those people, the more you get to know them, the feelings shift or dull because the novelty wears off. (That’s my own experience)

It’s not an inappropriate question, I think it’s something that is experienced universally and not discussed a lot at the workplace except during orientation or if it’s creating problems."

x8lupa,inkxp18,blackberryhands,2022-09-08 12:38:11,20,"I read past more than just the vore content, going into things like jealousy in relationships, how you discuss women generally, and how it all plays into who you are as a human being. 

People are complicated and of course we all have our own lives outside of our work, including interests and potentially “kinks” or “role play” but those desires I firmly believe come from a place in us, and examining that with another professional can make us into better counselors because we work through our own journey to know ourselves and where these desires come from. 

I’m not at all saying your roleplaying is wrong, but I do think generally the view of “predator” and “prey” in conjunction with being attracted to patients and coworkers, while wanting to work in a college setting, begins to create a picture where I think you’d greatly benefit working through this with your counselor versus looking for the Reddit bubble."

As to your question, I don’t have much to offer. Be mindful of what’s showing up for you without judging it, make space for whatever it is, and move in directions that move you closer to who you want to be personally and professionally. You already know or have an idea of what behavior works and what doesn’t—pick the workable options."

You don't need to be able to delineate the chart yourself. You can still respond to comments on how accurate they are with their attempts, since all you have to do is see if their comments fit the bio of the person. Please don't let feeling like you don't know enough stop you for this. Just follow the format and title-style of the previous one.

If there isn't a current one up, anyone may post one - first one sent in will get posted. Just make sure they are on astrodatabank, and have a data ranking of A or AA. It's best to make their chart yourself, even while linking the astrodatabank page, as their charts don't usually have all necessary information (such as degrees displayed on the chart).

x9yh8o,int327o,None,2022-09-10 02:19:11,5,"First of all, this is super sweet. Working with children is a little different in approach. The recommendation is actually to not formally take notes so a clipboard and pen would be very nice but it would likely not be used in her work. Something fantastic would be an easel with flip chart paper and drawing materials, board games or puppets (given they are not creepy ones). These are tools she could use with the kids. 

You could also get her a passion planner. It’s part day planner part diary. Psychologists go through a lot of emotions and thoughts in a day and having a place for her to write down her feelings and her day would be great. It helps to process information. People always forget psychologists need the same things as everyone else for mental well-being and giving her a place to express herself would be a great gift in my opinion. 

But anyway, I don’t think it really matters what you get at the end of the day the thought is just so sweet."

It gives the counselor a chance to teach kids the word ""phrenology"" if they ask about it. It's interesting because in terms of the type of model, phrenology is basically the same as a contemporary neurotopological model that is informed by fMRI data. Both match functions to specific regions on the brain. So as an educational tool it is actually a good model because it gets kids thinking about mapping functions to spatial regions on the brain! They are just bigger regions."

Really wasn’t beneficial for me long-term but I just looked at it as one of those unfortunate roadblocks I had to get through before becoming the teacher I am today, lol. 

I really didn’t enjoy placements either. Similar to your experience, all of my BEd classmates seemed to always be so excited for placement, but I never was. Found myself super anxious and overworked during them. Fast forward to now, I’m an actual teacher, and it’s way better than placement. I have my own kids, my own routines, my own materials, my own classroom, and I get to do what I want without being judged by another teacher 24/7. 

I wish you luck, I’m sure you’ll have a much better experience than that mess you were dealing with earlier. Just take it one day at a time and remember your end goal."
yu3qw3,iw8bnk1,Adramanta,2022-11-13 19:00:54,3,Don’t try to plan everything from scratch. I spent hours on slideshows etc during my practicum because I saw my CT using her own original resources and I felt I had to too. Teacherspayteachers has some free resources and there are many other free resources out there as well.

yu3qw3,iw7fdk3,gillsaurus,2022-11-13 15:24:02,1,"So the biggest thing about doing your practicum is having an open mind. Just because you’re an English/social studies student doesn’t mean that’s what you’ll be teaching since you’re doing a junior placement, not an IS one. If you plan on teaching elementary, you can’t be shaky with a certain subject. I absolutely hate phys ed because I have always been horrible at sports and had awful experiences in school. My first placement was with a 7/8 teacher who was also the phys ed lead but she was nice enough to let me focus on the rest of the subjects and just support her with phys ed lol. 

This is a great lesson on improvisation and management. If you cannot learn how to and cope with improvising now, then it will not bode well when you graduate and end up supplying."
yu3qw3,iw7hz2d,TinaLove85,2022-11-13 15:42:42,1,"It is completely natural to be nervous! Even experienced teachers get nervous about back to school or teaching a new course. It is unfortunate that your CT had to leave and you have not had a consistent experience. One way to think of it though is that the students have had you as a consistent adult even while they are going through a transition of teachers. It is always tough for students when their teacher changes (and for the teacher too) and you are seeing that in their behaviour. Is there a technique you saw your CT use to call attention? Count down, clapping pattern, phrase they repeat back, Waterfall, something. Honesty I am high school so I just say ""Grade X's, can I have your attention"" a few times and I don't teach if they are talking over me.

Don't compare your practicum to others.. I did that when my first and second practicum were not ideal and really it just continues even when you are hired. Different boards, schools, departments etc. always have pros and cons in their hiring, teacher placement, daily working conditions, planning expectations and it's easy to say the grass is greener on the other side. You will have more practicums, they could be very different. I see that when we have student teachers, some are more prepared than others... one fell asleep while observing because he said he was bored...being nervous means you care to do your best and that is all you can do as you are learning. Hope things are okay with the new CT!"

yu3qw3,iw8865e,Rockwell1977,2022-11-13 18:38:39,5,"I'm finding this out as well. I accepted my first OT position a few weeks ago since graduating teacher's college in June. My teachables are math and general science, but I graduated with a B. Eng in 2007, so my math is rusty and my formal science education was mainly limited to electricity and electronics. I was offered 4U data management class (I haven't taken probability and statistics in almost 20 years) and two grade 9 geography classes. Nobody the school called would accept this assignment, but I said that I'd take it, as long as I have the night prior to prepare for the day's lessons. I did, and everything went OK. I achieved my 10th day on Friday, which made it officially an LTO, and the regular classroom teacher is returning on Monday. There was a strike (CUPE) and there was news that a grade 12 student suddenly passed away (rumoured to be suicide) my first week there. I also had to do report cards, despite being with the students for less than two weeks. I had been meaning to ease into supply work, but I jumped off the deep end with this one. 

My advice is to prepare as much as you can the night before. Make your own PowerPoint lessons and, if you can, worksheets and handouts. This will force you to go through the process of thinking about your topic for the day. Rehearse your lesson ""script"" so that you have it in your head when you're in front of the class. This will all take some of the pressure of when you are. It's a ton of work, but preparing is the best way to mitigate stress and anxiety of not really knowing what you're doing. We (OP and I) are beginner teachers and, even though we have high expectations and standards for ourselves, it takes years or even decades to become a good teacher."

 In my own practicums, I had two, I never got more than three out of five. In my first contract TPA I got satisfactory. The options were unsatisfactory, satisfactory, exceeds expectations, and mastery. So you could say I got a C. 22 yeqes later, I'm still here. I learn. I grow. ."

zcz0it,iz2ytcn,Jaishirri,2022-12-06 02:03:21,2,"I'm going to disagree with others. For the most part, practicums are assessed based on current stage in the program. I have a first year candidate, their learning goals and expectations are different than a year 2 candidate in their final practicum. It is possible to achieve Meets or Exceeds expectations and there is no reason to hold back marks in consideration of future growth. Exceeds expectations doesn't mean a first year candidate is an exceptional A++ teacher, simply that they are exceeding the expectations for someone brand new to teaching. 

The average is likely 3 (Meets). But I'd think of it in terms of pass or fail anyway. Do you get to continue in the program? Then you've done well."

zcz0it,iz067xa,kcl84,2022-12-05 14:31:23,0,"Depends on your school and their marking system.

 If you’re getting a perfect score in your first 3 practicums, the teacher shouldn’t be taking in practicum students. Sorry, it’s not supposed to be that way. You should see a steady incline in your marks for practicum. You can get 3/5, but still show potential, because you’re willing learn, and read books to help your teaching beyond what your course offers. 

To get a 5/5 you need to be in your final practicum and teaching full time. 

Of course this is just depending on the rubrics for each of the practicum placements. 

There’s usually a check mark at the end, “pass.”"

ASHA had nothing stating you can’t be paid for your placement. HOWEVER. At my graduate school it was against the rules to do a placement at a place where I had been previously employed due to “conflict of interest” when it comes to grading. Which is bull.

y02f1p,irpru93,LizAnneCharlotte,2022-10-10 02:35:14,13,"Psychoeducation is a huge part of providing therapy. There is a saying, “never ascribe to malice what can be treated with knowledge.” You can do deeper work if education is ineffective and/or the parents offer resistance."
y02f1p,irpuvun,Sweet_Cinnabonn,2022-10-10 03:01:03,13,"I think virtually every child therapy is really parent education and therapy. Sometimes in disguise.

Typically if the kiddo needs therapy it is because the parents don't know how to parent the situation. Teaching them how not only addresses the immediate presenting problem, but potentially prevents future problems with the identified client, or even siblings."
y02f1p,irq54yd,Huge-Cauliflower2930,2022-10-10 04:40:23,11,"Buckle up my friend, as your friendly neighborhood Infant and Early Childhood Therapist I have a lot to say on this, so bear with me:

First, like a previous poster said, psychoeducation is HUGE with the infant and early childhood population. So many parents don’t have the knowledge or tools that they need to be able to support their kiddo in the best way. 90% of my job is parent education. Providing education to the parents is 100% therapeutic because it allows parents to facilitate the change within their family. I can tell you with the utmost certainty that if things at home and within the family system don’t change- nothing will! So provide that education and support, model, and encourage parents to implement changes. 

You may also want to have some family sessions without CT present. Support parents in exploring their parenting styles and see if they work together or if they clash. Help them work through that so they can be an effective team to support CT. 

Second: be wary with attributing behaviors to ADHD at such a young age. Keep in mind that most dx at this age manifest in ways that appear similar to what you’d see in ADHD with older kids. I HIGHLY encourage you to read/ study the DC: 0-5 to help you better understand diagnoses for this population. Some of the bx may be developmentally appropriate for a 4 yr old starting school. He may just need some extra support learning the ins and outs of the new environment. 

Third: You mention that parents are frustrated. Kiddo probably is too. One thing that often gets overlooked with this population is to validate their feelings and experiences just like you would any other age group. Just because he’s 4 doesn’t mean he isn’t frustrated, sad, overwhelmed, scared, etc. This is likely the hardest thing he’s done in his entire little life, he needs that validation just as much as a teen or adult client. 

Fourth: Games and art are WONDERFUL ways to teach new skills and can be incredibly useful in therapy. However, there is more to play therapy than just handing a kid some legos and talking about their struggles. I recommend you look at the Association for Play Therapy website to gain some helpful insight. As a play therapist it pains me when I see therapists using games in session without an identified modality or framework that guides how they’re using it. Please please please be intentional when using games in session! 

Research has shown that it can take up to 200 times for kids to learn something in a traditional lecture or verbal format VS as few as 10 times in experiential play activities. Providing quality play opportunities is very effective but again, it requires intention and thought to facilitate the activities. 

With this age nondirective modalities such as CCPT (Child Centered Play Therapy) can be very insightful and helpful. Nondirective modalities are traditionally difficult for clinicians to get used to and require quite a bit of practice before it feels ‘natural’. Despite the growing pains that come with a challenging modality, I highly recommend learning some to assist you with clients like these. I promise they work! 


Ok, I’ll step off my soap box for now! Good luck, this population can be challenging but also very rewarding. If any of the above mentioned play therapy information appeals to you, check out the APT website and come join us and become a registered play therapist- we have the most fun!"
y02f1p,irqeh7p,ActuallyActually3031,2022-10-10 06:34:32,3,"Maybe have them play with the child using prompts? Focus on the attachment. Kids will process things through play, and the parents may need to spend a little time playing with the child so the child learns it’s not all discipline and build some trust with the parents.

Their emotional state is deeply related to how effectively they are able to parent their child. The Working Model of the Child interview can be a helpful place to start. 

Also, look into the child’s temperament, sensory profile, sleep, and eating. Consider trauma history or anything else that the child might be having difficulty processing. And also consider whether the expectations in the preschool are age-appropriate - sometimes the school, not the kid, is the root of the problem."

I wonder if it situations like this, parents or staff think “behavior problem = see a therapist” when there might be other lenses that might be appropriate to look at things through to get a different perspective.

y02f1p,irr82hz,Huge-Cauliflower2930,2022-10-10 12:59:10,2,"That makes total sense, and yes! It happens all the time! Many families that I work with come in based on referrals for bx that definitely warrant further evaluations. I ask most families if they’ve had a chance to rule out physical causes- sleeping, eating, digestive issues, etc. I work in CMH so the case manager who works with my families helps a lot of them get appointments set up for those outside evaluations. Unfortunately, working in CMH in rural OK- there aren’t many resources for more in depth help. I’m fortunate to be trained in a wide variety of interventions for this age and I do A LOT of sensory integration work. So many of these kiddos have retained primitive reflexes and doing sensory integration is a game changer!  

If you have the ability to get an OT eval from an agency outside the school, I would give it a shot! Sometimes school based services are limited in their scope. 

I’ve also found in recent years that I’m doing a lot of teacher education. Like a crap ton lol. Again, I’m in rural OK…and we’re 48th in education and in a huge teacher shortage (no wonder…but I won’t get started on that). So many teachers haven’t been properly educated themselves on classroom management and challenging behaviors. So I always do a functional assessment with teachers/ school staff to see if there are ways that they’re unintentionally contributing to the struggles. I mean, we’ve all lived through a global pandemic and it’s understandable when they’re at their wits end and can’t be as gentle as this population needs. However, it’s not fair to the kids. So you may want to gently inquire about that too."

It really helps parents reflect on how they were parented and identify changes they want to make. It promotes healthy attachment and builds confidence of parents. It’s wonderful! It’s best for families with kiddos ages 0-5. 

I also teach Positive Solutions for Families. It’s geared to families with kids ages 2.5-17. It’s more solution focused around behaviors but it also touches on attachment. It’s got a great resource for all sorts of behaviors for parents that lays out “if kiddo is doing x, they may be seeking x, y, z. You should focus on teaching/ reteaching these skills (enter applicable skills here) to help them learn appropriate bc in this situation. You should also modify how you handle when they do x.”


Some parents aren’t in a place where they can handle the reflective nature of CoS so PSF can fit better until they’re able to heal and be ready for CoS! I have several families who I start with PSF then move into the CoS class when things have calmed down enough at home that everyone is out of ‘survival mode’.

Edited to add: sorry it took so long to respond! 

But I also want to add that infant massage classes are an awesome resource! It can help parents learn how to be physically affectionate with their babies in safe ways. So many parents didn’t grow up seeing adults love on babies and snuggle them, meet their needs, take the baby’s lead on what’s wrong, etc. It’s great for attachment! It’s also good for colicky babies, gas issues, and muscle tone (great for FAS, DS, CF babies)."

They claim you should not be placed more than 60 minutes commute from your house, or 90 minutes (depending on the source) and will still place you even farther at times. They have more pull with TDSB than anywhere else. You cannot find your own placement or suggest a teacher or school. Once you pick a board, you cannot change it until 2nd year."
zmcnsx,j0bpjyq,blissfullyignant,2022-12-15 14:18:25,4,"1. I did not get paid
2. Practicum was nerve wracking but do-able while still working my full time job. I needed to dedicate about 10 hours/week - 6-8 clients.
3. I had a really hard time securing a practicum and needed to defer a year as a result. It is challenging in Toronto if you don't already work in the field. I ended up having to pay 5k to the organization that accepted me. It is not uncommon for students to have to pay to cover their weekly supervision during their practicum. 
4. I did my masters at Yorkville U
5. I had previously studied CYC, but was working in an unrelated field 
6. I was very fortunate to be connected with a great mentor following my practicum. Currently working in private practice, very happy with my decision."

Also, your baby is due in the best month :P"
xn0t42,ipqznmp,DoctorSweetheart,2022-09-24 19:01:10,20,"Have you discussed this with your director of clinical training? That should be the first step before talking to the site.

What country? What is BBS?

 I can't speak for every state or anywhere outside the US, but where I went to school and where I supervise students now, practicum is an educational experience not a ""volunteer"" experience.  If you are getting a grade and credit, it's a class. 

I had a pregnant prac student once. She took a few weeks off when she had the baby and came back when she was ready. 

This is also really, really common among doctoral interns. Almost every large consortium cohort deals with this, and it usually just extends the contract until the hours are complete."
xn0t42,ipr616z,fandog15,2022-09-24 19:46:48,4,"I did my internship while pregnant, so I was in a similar boat and was about 4 months along when I started. 

Do you have a supervisor through school? I talked extensively with mine about how to broach the subject and what my anxieties were. It really helped me feel prepared to tell my internship site. I told both the internship coordinator and my clinical supervisor within the first few weeks of me being there  for a few reasons - because I wanted it out of the way and wanted plenty of time to plan my leave with their guidance. My pregnancy ended up being relevant in a few of the cases I worked on, so having them know early allowed me to process things with them in an honest way.

I know everyone’s experience will be different, but I found that in general, people in this field were highly supportive of my needs surrounding my maternity leave. It was across the board, too, from coworkers, supervisors, professors, school admin - they all handled it well!"
xn0t42,iptugzh,r3adiness,2022-09-25 11:43:26,2,"Please talk to your school as well as your site. I work at site that has trainees and I’ve taught at the masters level for a local program. familiar with the BBS. 

Masters level practicum students are with sites (usually CMH sites) for such a short amount of time to begin with for traineeship - it’s September to May usually. We have a practicum students on site and it would be really difficult to accommodate an absence of 2 months of 8 month practicum for individual and family therapy. If you worked at our placement, you would not be given individual clients with a leave by mid December. We have a waitlist that’s already too long and we would have to consider the impact on the children and families. You’d be assigned to assessments or group only until your leave was sorted (though it sounds like you will be on leave for the spring semester which is probably a good idea! But it’ll limit what you can do before mid December). Ive supervised trainees and unless the ED is your direct supervisor they probably won’t be the one taking the hit of client reassignment and/or productivity loss. I reduce my caseload by 2 clients if I’m supervising because it takes time. The earlier I knew it was happening the easier it would be to navigate. 

Are you planning on re-applying next school year from this placement? I’d give them as much lead time as possible. It would make me consider offering the possibility of a second year with the student who has communicated well and considered all the things you mentioned in the post. 

Your hours don’t matter right now. No one is getting a giant portion of that 3000 hours in traineeship and you have 6 years to collect your hours. It’s a rolling six years so if you need more time the earliest hours are what drop off. You won’t be the first to have this happen! Definitely had pregnant classmates and some had no impact on hours and other ended up taking 7 years. It doesn’t matter once you are licensed (and you will get there!)

Your school’s practicum/placement program will have advice too. This definitely happens! They should be able to guide you next steps on the school end (having to do another around of practicum etc) and how they have communicated leave with sites in the past. 

Good luck navigating this situation and congratulations! You’ll figure it out even if it takes an additional practicum year. Enjoy your bébé!"
xn0t42,ipu33wg,SorchasGarden,2022-09-25 13:07:56,2,What sort of work are you doing in your practicum? Are virtual sessions a possibility?
xn0t42,ipuc529,Fabulous-Flower-2328,2022-09-25 14:21:08,2,"Hello! I’m a current MSW student and am 7 months pregnant. I told my practicum site supervisor during our initial supervision meeting so they could have plenty of time to plan ahead. 

My advice would be to come prepared with a plan for what exact dates you will take off and how you will make up any missed hours. My school’s practicum liaison gave me permission to continue my practicum into the summer, if needed, to make sure I get all the hours I need. I have been fortunate that my site supervisor has been very understanding and flexible so we were able to get it worked out.

I spoke to my school’s liaison before letting my site supervisor know. She did warn me that the practicum site was under no obligation to allow me to take maternity leave during my practicum and that they may not be able to accommodate my leave. While I think it’s super messed up to deny maternity leave to an intern, I would still be prepared for that possibility. 

Good luck!! Being pregnant in grad school in no joke."

I'm just hoping that my pregnancy won't delay my graduation by more than one quarter. That may be wishing on a star. I had hoped that perhaps I could do all the intakes and possibly groups. I've requested meetings with my advisor and clinical site coordinator at me school to prep me to speak to my site director. My internship is actually a commitment of two years."

I had a girl in my grad program get pregnant like 2 or 3 quarters into our almost three year program and she ended up taking a few classes with us after and just didn’t start clinical with us and just joined the class behind us with their clinicals and any of the classes she wasn’t able to take while pregnant/after giving birth until she was ready to come back
xn0t42,ipr6eq9,DoctorSweetheart,2022-09-24 19:49:33,4,"Ok, I wasn't sure if it was British Behavioral Society,  and didn't want to overstep since I know nothing about the UK.

Traditional doctoral students are usually about 25-28 years old during internship, which is about the same as maternal age for first births in the US. It definitely happens.  I know your situation I'd different,  just trying to illustrate that they have almost certainly dealt with this before. 

Again, because the training experience is for school credit, it's very important to work with your training director to plan this out. Your school is probably a bigger player here than the site."

I hated telling people about my pregnancy cause I’d get all worked up about their reaction but 99.9% of people were just happy for me. Babies are wonderful! (Btw - congrats!

xn0t42,ipuggjd,r3adiness,2022-09-25 14:53:36,1,"Oh wonderful! Having a 2 year commitment is great - they chose you because they wanted *you*! Having a baby is A Lot (tm) so planning for a semester as opposed to a quarter isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If a quarter off is enough time, awesome! Still probably good to do some contingency planning (not even because anything is wrong - you just don’t know until you deliver!)

Grad school can feel so urgent and overwhelming when you are in it without any external elements!"

zmc7s9,j0w8lwo,kushdeeper,2022-12-19 21:52:06,1,This was actually my 4th site but I had to eliminate the previous 3 due to the hour’s requirement and population.
yvlh2e,iwgsits,cRAY_Bones,2022-11-15 15:12:25,2,"MOU is a district requirement more so than a university one.

If a school didn’t want or care than I’m sure your uni would be flexible, but the other way around won’t really happen. 

I also did all my practicum and fieldwork at a school district that I was already employed and still had to wait *MONTHS* to get and MOU."
yvlh2e,iwxlyxl,None,2022-11-19 03:06:18,2,"When I was doing my M.Ed. I took a two-year break to complete an M.S. in Counseling Psychology and then used my practicum and internship to meet the field experience for both universities at the same time.

There was a lot of documentation required - including expectations of my site supervisors, my role, and my hours... but that was really it.

At both schools, I was the only counselor on site.  I was supervised by an off-site district counselor, my university doctoral-level preceptor, and a licensed clinical psychologist.  As a result of that and my graduate degrees, I'm license-eligible for substance abuse counseling, mental health counseling, and school counseling in most states and several countries.  I'm also license-eligible as a psychological assistant or associate psychologist in several states which use that license.

My duties were different between the practicum and internship - but that's primarily because my population was different.

For my practicum I actually did about 600 hours (instead of the 100 required) because they needed me.  It was in an alternative charter high school for at-risk youth.

For my internship, I received a paid position as the sole school counselor for a year in a school for roughly 300 students in grades K-8 - 90% of whom qualified for homeless services under MKV.

In the first school, I focused a lot on psychosocial interventions and vocational preparedness.  

In the second school, it varied a lot more.  I did psychological testing, designed and delivered the counseling curriculum, and provided individual counseling to 30 ED kids each week, I also lead parent education groups, taught the teachers crisis intervention techniques, and provided counseling services to the staff after hours.  It was 100% trial by fire - but, I'm damn good at what I do because of it.

My suggestion is to use this time to challenge yourself as much as you possibly can.  Jump into the deep end head-first and figure out how to swim once you're there.  You'll have preceptors, college professors, other students in your practicum and internship classes... all of who can help you.

And get as much supervision from as many people as you possibly can.  Consult and collaborate until you're dreaming of asking other counselors what they think and how they'd handle a situation.

When you get in the real world, you'll need that information... and there won't be any failsafe.  You will be the safety net for the kids you serve, and if you have a gap in your knowledge, your understanding, your ethics, the people you serve will pay - and so will your career."
yvlh2e,iwk9cnn,pretendberries,2022-11-16 06:30:52,1,They made you wait months?? That’s so unfair! Geez.  Well thanks for clarifying that!
yvlh2e,ix6tvgt,pretendberries,2022-11-21 04:34:20,2,"Thank you so much for the advice, I’m writing this down.  I’ll have to work under three counselors so that’s a plus for me. I hope when I do my internship I can do more than the expected hours."
ydxl1v,itwjvbl,-Math-Addict-,2022-10-26 20:42:55,13,"Hi there. Veteran teacher here. I’ve had many TC’s at different stages of their programs and every single one of them has been an unique experience. 

I think there are so many things to mention that I could never convey them all. However I will try to share some main ideas. I’ll share as kind of an “open letter” style to any TC, as every single one brings different experiences and different expectations. 

First and foremost, I am a teacher who is there to listen to, understand, and teach the group of children that are in front of me every day. These students change and evolve over the course of the year, and so must I. Also, this group of children is different from last year’s and will be different from next year’s. So when you are observing, making notes deciding on teaching strategies, and  behaviour management strategies, know that what I do now, is only because that’s what these students need, and what they respond to. Last year’s group would eat me alive if I tried what I am doing this year.  Be who they need. 

I have been teaching a long time. I have done my very best to stay current in research informed practices. I run my classroom centred around student thinking. Yes I want you to watch me. Yes I want you to take things away from my room into your own practice. I do not want to turn you into me. I want you to take what makes sense to you and do it in your own way. I have my own biases. I openly admit to these. I hope you challenge me on mine as I will challenge you on yours. 

Which segues nicely into my next point. Ask questions. Ask students questions. Ask me questions. Most importantly, as me “why questions.” As in “Why did you choose to do blank this way instead of…” this opens conversations about the why of teaching and the intentionality of a teacher. On the flip side, be ready to be asked the same why questions. I ask them not to trip you up, not to question your judgement, but to get you to articulate what student learning you were going for and consider all the possible realities of you chose to do it differently. 

Bring your own personality to the class. Don’t feel pressure to be someone you’re not.  Use your personality to connect with children to let them get to know you and trust you a bit and then you can learn more about them.  

When you are teaching, I will absolutely let you fall flat on your face. I will watch lessons go down in flames and as long as no one is in danger, I will let it go. There is more to be learned in the failure and the talk afterward than being rescued. No one rescues me. And I have to clean up my own messes. And trust me. I’ve made some doozies. I just tell the students, “look, I’m sorry. I got ahead of myself yesterday and I wasn’t being an effective teacher. I wasn’t meeting your needs. And I apologize. Let’s start again and see if I can be more successful today.”

Finally, come with curiosity. I most certainly don’t have all the answers. But talking about the thinking is more than half the battle. 

Things I don’t like? I’ve had to have tough conversations about being punctual, professional in behaviour and dress. 

Those were probably the most egregious save for a couple of specific incidences. 

I’m happy to answer any more questions if you have any. That’s all I can think of now."
ydxl1v,itvhu6c,Zelldandy,2022-10-26 16:41:39,11,"My AT said her TCs before me had **terrible** communication when it came to absences and late arrival. Some wouldn't show up and she would be frantic thinking something happened to them, but no, they'd just sleep in and decide not to go. I couldn't believe it. Don't do that to your ATs."

ydxl1v,itvdies,HormoneMonsterr,2022-10-26 16:13:24,8,"I'm not an AT yet (Lol, classic Reddit), but the biggest thing that helped me as a teacher candidate--and continues to help me as a teacher now--was being willing to make mistakes. No one is perfect, especially when learning a new skill. 

Messing up is a part of the process! There's a reason why so many educators prioritize Growth Mindset in their classrooms. 

Your first weeks will likely be spent observing / supporting your AT and building a good rapport with students. If they want you to hit the ground running with a lesson right off the bat, go for it!! It'll never be harder than the first time you do it. 

Once as a teacher candidate I made a dumb mistake in a math lesson. I was mortified, and stopped the lesson to check my thinking out loud and then I awkwardly got us back on track. 

I was SO embarrassed, and dreaded what my AT would say when we sat down for some feedback but she was actually delighted at how things had gone. 

She said she didn't want to step in and rescue me, because a little (what she called) productive struggle would do much more for me in the long run. 

Also, she told me that modeling making and correcing my own mistakes would likely make students more willing to ask me for help if they were stumped (we had a lot of them who'd hide when they were confused due to embarrassment or pride). And she was right, that was exactly what happened!

Last thing, look carefully at the teachers who seem always stressed, and at the ones who breeze through calm cool and collected. In my experience the difference is largely organization and attitude. The kids will absorb your emotional state, if you're stressed they'll get disregulated. If you can go with the flow, laugh at yourself, and be the adult when they need one you'll be serving them well. 

Have a blast, be brave, and enjoy everything! You got this!!"
ydxl1v,itwki6q,DownTheWalk,2022-10-26 20:46:57,3,"I’ve been an AT many times before. 

Good:
1.	Be yourself while working within a community. Practice developing a style of your own. Be yourself and let your personality infect your practice. Recognize that your flourishing needs to work with the community that will exist when you’re gone.
2.	Work hard and/to inform yourself and, if you don’t know something, find clarification when necessary. It’s impossible to know everything as a new teacher (even as an experienced teacher), but you’ll learn a lot by asking questions, observing, listening, reading, or whatever works for you. I’ve also had one student teacher who was totally averse to working to build their own lessons. They wanted materials handed to them and didn’t listen to instruction. While it’s always a privilege to be supported (and I *always* give my TCs my materials to use and reflect on), simply demanding or expecting materials isn’t the same thing as demanding and expecting help.

Not so good:
1.	Not doing the above two things or not taking feedback."

They have feelings and interests and hobbies. If you get to know them then they'll open up to you more. And, with P/J, wear something that is professional but something you can 100% get messy."
ydxl1v,itwyinv,neonsneakers,2022-10-26 22:21:15,2,"Lots of people have said great things about the teaching side of things. A few things I haven't seen are: 


- be open to feedback. Being defensive isn't going to help anything. Ask for feedback and apply it. You may think a lesson or day has gone really well, but your AT may be seeing things you are not. 

- be confident but not arrogant. 

- be open to new and different experiences. If another teacher who is not your AT offers you a chance to observe them, or participate in PD, or join another experience (like a field trip), take them up on it. 

In general, the more open minded and sponge-like you go into this, the more you will get out of it."

ydxl1v,itwtkhm,Several-Reach-3356,2022-10-26 21:46:51,1,Thank you for this response. It was very helpful. How do ATs in general would you say judge a lesson that falls apart (when you say you won't rescue). I am fine with that and actually think I am similar with my kinder students. What I wonder is what this will translate to on my evaluation. I don't want to fail practicum because my lesson didn't work out. I think I am good for professionalism. I've worked as a permanent DECE in a school for a number of years. I have done unqualified supply teaching work too. But there is something about practicum that makes me nervous (I think its the feeling of being judged and not being good enough and then being evaluated).

ydxl1v,itxacyx,Ebillydog,2022-10-26 23:50:17,4,"The reality of teaching is that sometimes lessons do fall apart. Even experienced teachers have lessons they thought would go over well that don't. Or have students who for whatever reason are unable to focus on a particular day. Bombing a single lesson is okay, as long as a) it's not because you were unprepared and b) you are willing to ask for feedback from your AT \*\*\*and then implement the feedback the next time\*\*\*. You are a student, and like all students you have lots to learn. Your ATs don't expect you to be a perfect teacher, they expect you to try your best, to learn from your mistakes, and to grow during the course of your practicum. The one suggestion I have, if you are in P/J, is to always have a backup plan in case things go sideways or the kids need a break. I like to have a movement video or game always queued up and ready, and if I see the students getting antsy I will stop the lesson and have them do something active. In one of my practicums, I cut one of my lessons way short and did something else instead, and my AT praised me for doing it, because it was what the students needed that day and trying to force curriculum on them when they weren't able to receive it wouldn't have gone over well."
ydxl1v,iujs3ez,-Math-Addict-,2022-10-31 21:24:31,1,"I absolutely support the comment that was made below(?). Yes. A bombed lesson isn’t the end of the world. Ask for feedback. Take the feedback and implement it. That’s the make or break. Not whether or not any one lesson went south. Again, aside from being completely unprepared. 

So when a TC has a lesson not go as planned, when we are debriefing I always ask the following questions. Not all at once, but through conversation. 

What was your goal? What were you expecting students to do? When you did the work yourself how many different ways did you anticipate student thinking to diverge? What did they do that was outside of your expectations? Were they missing background knowledge or underpinning skills? What do you need to change, or build-in to the lesson next time? 

It’s always a learning experience even when it goes exactly to plan!"
ydxl1v,itvq4gm,HormoneMonsterr,2022-10-26 17:34:53,2,"I think that's a great attitude to have going in! 

The majority of ATs open their classes up to teacher candidates because they love to teach, and they want to support and guide their future colleagues.

The unknown is always the worst part, but your openness and willingness to learn, as well as your existing confidence will set you up for a good experience. 

Wishing you all the best!"

yhfth8,iuef4gc,ecobeast76,2022-10-30 18:25:53,3,Do not try to wow people or act like a superstar. You are not. You are a student who is there to learn. If you act like you’re trying to wow them then you will have a very rough time.  You are basically going to single yourself out. In nursing school you need to do what is asked and that’s it.

There are a few things...

* You have not been working as a nurse on that unit, you have been working as a tech. While we are all part of the same team, etc., but there is a different thought process between techs and nurses.  Being a good tech does not always translate to being a good RN, trust me, I have seen ED Techs that have worked for 3-7 years and are fantastic ED Techs, who struggle mightily with transitioning to the RN role in the same department.
* Don't try to impress, try to do the best job you can, but don't try to force it or make it happen. In my experience, those who try to impress, wind up doing the opposite.
* Know what you don't know.
* I would 100% have conversation with your preceptor about what she expects from you, and make sure she is helping create the space for you to learn to be an RN, not doing your tech job for free for school..."
yhfth8,iudlh46,jerbisking100,2022-10-30 15:05:17,1,And show that I am a good nurse.
yhfth8,iufqz45,hwaeteva,2022-10-30 23:53:53,3,"Nothing said above is inaccurate. Students are not nurses, let alone *good* nurses. It takes a year or more of independent practice as an RN or LPN to become a good nurse. Students who try to “wow” or “impress” preceptors or instructors frequently end up doing the exact opposite. I am personally far more concerned when working with a cocky student who tries to impress me with their knowledge, than I am when working with a student who asks appropriate questions and acknowledges their limitations."
yhfth8,iufybqf,what_up_peeps,2022-10-31 00:50:59,2,I agree with don’t try to impress. Just learn at a good pace for yourself. Realize when a limit is hit and utilize resources available.
yhfth8,iudp0i1,theducker,2022-10-30 15:30:19,5,"But you're not though. No one is at the end of their preceptorship as a new grad, much less when they're about to start your last semester of school. 
Be humble, receptive to learning and ask lots of good questions. Do your best to seek out opportunities to learn and practice skills. Impress them with your interest and willingness to learn"
yhfth8,iuehxc4,ecobeast76,2022-10-30 18:44:38,4,You aren’t a good nurse.  You’re not a nurse.  You’re a student.

Think about what parts of the hw you have most trouble with and try to redo those parts in a timed environment. If your practicum in on paper or in an IDE that doesn’t give you syntax suggestions/errors, do those problems outside of vscode. These are suggestions that involve writing code. You should probably include hand tracing your code and talking aloud to yourself about what the code is doing and what you expect. This is coming from someone who did the practice exams for practicum one and three (got A’s on both) but didn’t study for the second (got a ~25). When I did the redo at the end, I had so much coding practice from the semester and from the final project that I finished the redo with an A in under 15 minutes. Now, I’m in DS where I didn’t study much at all for either of mine so I need a 75% on the redo in order to not fail.

ydho0s,its9itt,Financial-Fig6235,2022-10-25 22:43:48,12,"I’ve taught a tattoo lesson with middle school. We spent one class discussing tattoos, what they are, how they work, their origins. I tried to find engaging short videos to help. Then the next class we had a “Flash Day” where I printed out tiny, cliche tattoo designs & my students had to tattoo them on a banana. Basically they put the printed image on the banana, poke with a thumbtack & within minutes it oxidizes & turns brown in that spot. I took a picture of their banana & then they could eat it or throw it out. The class after that they had to design a flash sheet. We looked at a ton of examples but I asked them to focus on 2-3 images for their flash sheet. I also encouraged a theme. They drew them, painted them, outlined in sharpie. I then took photos of one of their tattoos, removed the background, & printed it out on temporary tattoo paper (got it on Amazon). They were able to put the tattoo they created on their body. I also had their home room teachers choose one tattoo from
The classes flash sheet & printed them one as well so the kids could see their art on someone else. It was a successful lesson, with a high success rate. I have slides if you want me to send them along just let me know."
ydho0s,ituwtav,snakefield,2022-10-26 14:21:46,4,"In contemporary American culture, lots of tattoos people end up regretting. Have them design a tattoo that they would have loved at one point, but would now regret it. Could be someone they were in a relationship with, a fad they followed, religion or something dumb like a TV show or movie. Have them write a small essay about their choice and what changed in them, who they were then vs now. 

Could connect it to cover up tattooing. How could they change it to something else or re design it for themselves today or maybe they have to re design a classmates tattoo."
ydho0s,itso1d9,EstablishmentNo675,2022-10-26 00:33:05,3,"When I was in high school my teacher had us design a tattoo, but we had to draw it in context (draw the body part we would place the tattoo). So we had to consider size, placement, and how the tattoo would appear naturally on the skin (would it curve because it was along the arch or your foot, how would it appear on a shoulder, etc). It had to be realistic and not flat on the paper. This combined some figure drawing with the tattoo design. Not sure if that is what you already had in mind or not."
ydho0s,ituli8e,batgirlsxe,2022-10-26 12:56:18,3,See I'd love to do a tattoo lesson but am terrified I'll get an angry email or call from home. I live in the Bible belt so I've been warned to tread lightly many times. Anyone else in the south and have done a lesson like this?

z4u1yl,ixwa2r5,Slugbums,2022-11-26 21:42:49,2,Pretty easy to get a spot in Calgary or Edmonton. It’s the small towns that fill up quick. You shouldn’t have a problem.
z4u1yl,izjx9dl,CheesyHotDogPuff,2022-12-09 17:31:16,2,"Sait PCP grad from 2021 here.

When I was at SAIT you didn't have a choice as to where your practicums were, although that may have changed. Personally if you get a chance to choose yours, I would recommend trying to get a spot in a suburban station (Cochrane, Airdrie, Okotoks, Strathmore, Priddis), you still get a good call volume without the rush of Metro, where it's go-go-go for the whole 12 hours. Plus you'll often get called into the city so you'll still get some good metro experience. 

Longer transport times also often means you'll get more chances to use your full scope of practice, which is nice for getting your competencies done.

Metro is also good as well, just through the sheer volume of calls you get. It can be a little overwhelming for some people as a student, but if that's your thing go for it. Just avoid rural stations if you can, it can be difficult to get all your competencies completed due to low call volume, plus you're on the hook for accommodations.

If you have any questions feel free to PM me"
z4u1yl,ixuport,Zenmedic,2022-11-26 14:49:52,1,"There are usually lots of Calgary spots, so it's kind of the default.  If that's the one you are looking for, it is highly likely you'll get it."

ymqnvp,iv53meu,smurtzenheimer,2022-11-05 11:19:23,17,"This kind of thing has to be reported to your university program director ASAP. They need to know what they're sending their students to and this center needs to be crossed off the list of cooperating schools. Also the sooner you report back to your program, the better chance you have of getting moved to a better placement. 

These are the things that should come up in weekly seminar. Speaking up about a poorly run classroom should reflect well on you (it is our professional duty to be able to evaluate a quality program) and reflect badly only on the shitty classroom or center. You are there to learn, not be a maid, and a school or center that operates out of compliance needs to be reported."

ymqnvp,iv545jy,mmmmango,2022-11-05 11:25:57,3,"I’m so sorry this is happening, this is not what student teaching should feel like. Do you have an advisor or student teaching coordinator that you can talk to? When I was student teaching, I was placed in a setting that did not help me meet my goals for the type of experience I wanted/needed for a certain certification. I had to be pretty firm with my advisor and document a rationale for how the experience did not provide me with the necessary experiences and what my goals were. Also, would it be possible to bring any of these concerns to your AT? You could frame it around a conversation of what your learning objectives are for this practicing and how you’re not meeting them.

A wise mentor once told me to document anytime I encountered problem situations and this would be a time to document. Keep track of how often you’re pulled from your classroom or used for ratio. It would also be good to put these concerns in writing for the university so they don’t place any future students there too, but it sounds like you plan to do that. Best of luck!"
ymqnvp,iv6o1q9,EyeSad1300,2022-11-05 18:42:33,1,"We had to do 4 practicums. One in a kindergarten was great, one ece had 4 different tertiary providers sending student teachers so wasobviously a way to have extra staff on the floor for cleaning, feeding and supervising nap time so the paid staff could be released to write narrative assessments. Last one had attachment theory so I spent 4 weeks sweeping, cleaning tables, folding washing over and over again. Talked to my visiting lecturer who observed me doing this. She just shrugged afterwards due to my frustration of being treated as unpaid laborer who was learning nothing on my placement, and said the uni needs to send us somewhere to make the placement time component.
I work back in primary education now and have a student teacher each year as part of a masters programme for a uni and make sure that they get to learn, teach, they’re not cleaners or to step in when staff away - the uni is very clear about that"

I told them that I was not paying to learn what not to do as it would not teach me what to do. They switched  me to a really good placement .

Practicum ( at least my knowledge of it) is designed to provide you with hands on experience that allows you to feel confident to lead a room on your own. Even as an aide in room you will need to focus on more than 1 child at a time. 
There are many other fields that ECE can lead into that may be a better fit for you.

If you're looking for ideas on how to regulate your own stress I can definitely give you some tips! 

1)breathe. Like SUPER deep, from your belly. All day, at every transition while you're at school. This will help keep your nervous system regulated. 

2) set clear boundaries. State what you need/expect and the consequence if your boundary isn't respected. And follow through. Don't ask more than once. So ""this is my body and I need space. If you can't give me space I'll move my body away."" And walk away, if they keep following you sit them down at a table with an activity and take a bathroom break. 

3) ask for help. Even if you had all of this figured out, you can't do it alone. Add in that you're still learning, you need lots of help navigating this. It's HARD. 

4) You can be kind and firm at the same time. Don't let them walk over you in the sake of being nice. Chances are you're new, young, and they know they can take advantage of you. Don't let them. Set those boundaries and hold them. Don't play the games. When they run away with your pen just get a new one. Don't let them see you sweat. If you're getting worked up take those deep breaths and pretend like you don't care."

I have great days and i still have energy after work even after a 10 hour shift. Try different ave groups!"
yp89gn,ivjitzh,None,2022-11-08 13:02:19,1,"I really struggle with ages 4-6. I don’t know why, but I always have. If I were to go back on the floor, I would *not* work with older preschoolers, I would be working with infants/toddlers or maybe 2-3 year olds. Not every age group is for everyone!

As for working one on one, it might be worth looking into careers where you can work more one on one with children like speech pathologist etc. It would mean more education, but I think the pay would be better & you wouldn’t be managing large groups of children"

z38nal,ixkkop9,Ancient_Ad1271,2022-11-24 03:24:10,1,Target and Old Navy are good places to find affordable work clothes. I always try to be a little more dressed up than the teachers.
z38nal,ixkvrzt,IndependentSet5750,2022-11-24 05:08:38,1,I’ve had practicum students ask me what they should wear and I’m happy to answer them! So don’t hesitate to reach out to your supervisor and ask 🙂
z4u3um,ixtedjk,Ok-Bug755,2022-11-26 04:56:58,1,Practical is exiting. But you don’t get to choose when or where you go in this course. Spots are very limited for practicum so whenever one opens they ship you off. I assume that Calgary and Edmonton have the most placements bc the amount of hospitals. It all just comes down to luck however
z4u3um,ixvwanf,ryanmartin13,2022-11-26 20:04:33,1,"SAIT PCP Graduate 2022 here, practicum for me was awesome. I was placed at No2 station on 10th. Most people in my class were in Calgary for our ambulance prac, with a few outside of Calgary (If you are outside of YYC all expenses are yours) For our clinical Prac a lot of us weren’t placed in YYC, and when they were it was an urgent care Center (not the best for learning IMO) I was lucky and got placed at CRH in Lethbridge. Just be prepared that your clinical, if placed at a UCC isn’t all it’s chalked up to be. Some of my friends at UCC’s didn’t even get to start a single line, just due to the nature of the site. Hope this helps."
z4u3um,ixwxbtd,Tazinyyc,2022-11-27 00:46:14,1,">Thank you! Great info.   
>  
>Can you explain the differnece between the ambulance and the clinal practicum in term of lenght, and when you complete them during the course? If you get placed out of YYC for your clincal is the cost also on you? Appriciate it"
z4u3um,ixwxxsm,ryanmartin13,2022-11-27 00:51:17,1,"Any cost is on you. You could get placed in peace river and have to pay everything to live there until your practicum is done. Ambulance prac for me was 192 hours +/- OT, Late calls, etc. You follow the AHS full time platoon rotation of 2 days, 2 nights, 4 days off. 

Clinical was around 60 hours I believe? And you just follow whatever schedule your preceptor has. (I travelled YYC-Lethbridge around 4 times and had to stay in a hotel each night) 

Clinical for me was in February, with the majority of my classmates being in and around that time. The earliest was Last week of Jan and latest mid-March (again going off nothing but memory)

Ambulance starts after you finish everything, you have to write a test similar to the COPR in order to “pass” onto ambulance prac. Mine was May 20th-Jun 20th. Some started earlier and later, just like clinical. 

Hope this helps, always happy to answer any other questions you might have"
z7yr69,iybfa5m,throwaway_x398437,2022-11-30 03:34:15,1,"It's pretty school-specific, especially in Ontario - most Ontario schools have moved to cGPA, so there's no more weighting or dropping courses/years. 

The schools that still have a wGPA will have their own individual rules and regulations around how they calculate GPA and how they consider practicum courses (which are generally classified as a P/F course)."
xt3k5h,iqojbxx,ZodiacDax,2022-10-01 22:51:09,21,I like this idea. Let's discuss.
xt3k5h,iqokhst,BlueMountainLantern,2022-10-01 23:00:09,9,Sounds fun and logistically messy lol
xt3k5h,iqorf27,siren5474,2022-10-01 23:54:41,3,i also like this— do we need restrictions on the kinds of questions? does the one that posts the chart decide who did the best job answering?
xt3k5h,iqru696,LuminescentGathering,2022-10-02 17:16:55,1,I like this idea and would love to participate!
xt3k5h,iqrw3py,tor1dactyl,2022-10-02 17:28:43,1,I love this! What sorts of questions would be asked?
xt3k5h,iqs9t9c,Redrodder,2022-10-02 18:52:16,1,"I love the idea. We could try to establish the time of important events in one's life. I guess that meets the criteria ""who comes the closest"" the best. Of course other types of questions could be even more fun."
xt3k5h,iqp2u0t,tiawyn,2022-10-02 01:27:11,1,"Not sure what you mean by ""closest."" Does it mean the people who are asking know the answer to their question and how it shows up in their chart? Or simple questions like ""guess my career"" kinda thing?"
xt3k5h,iqokr86,swaon_dav,2022-10-01 23:02:08,13,Maybe we can ask with a poll if people want to participate and just do it. :) It is such engaging way to practice and learn in the same time. Thank you :)
xt3k5h,iqoliih,swaon_dav,2022-10-01 23:07:55,10,just like reddit :)
xt3k5h,iqqee16,swaon_dav,2022-10-02 10:11:03,3,"Yes, the person who posts the chart should decide who has given the right answers to the question, which means the person should be familiar with the chart. Not just random celebrity chart. We used to do normal people's charts instead. Sometimes the person can use their chart but I'm not sure if this is allowed in the sub. It make sense to ask something that is possible to be answered. It all depends. Sometimes it flows sometimes it doesn't."
xt3k5h,iqrxux4,swaon_dav,2022-10-02 17:39:18,1,"I remember back then, once someone in the group posted very obscure chart and asked what are the tree main characteristics of that person.. it was a lot of fun. Later we found out it was a girl raised by wolves, literally. :)"
xt3k5h,iqsl0e3,swaon_dav,2022-10-02 19:59:47,1,"of course, but timing events is very laborious task and is not for everyone, but it is a good possibility for those who are up for such challenge."
xt3k5h,iqqdzj8,swaon_dav,2022-10-02 10:06:09,4,"The person who post the chart should know the chart or at least understands it enough to be able to put forward questions for others to find out and answer. That's the whole point, learning by practice in a community, where you can learn also from other. Its like investigating. Hints can be given along parameters like: use traditional only, use ur-nep-pl or anything else that can help solving the questions. At least thats how we used to do it. We can come up with something else if we think of :)"
xt3k5h,iqokvyi,ZodiacDax,2022-10-01 23:03:07,7,"No polls, but a discussion is good."
xt3k5h,iqrydc6,tor1dactyl,2022-10-02 17:42:19,3,This is so fun! Patrick Watson described a game he likes to play on a recent episode of the Astrology Podcast where he'll pull random charts of famous people with his partner (I think?) and they try to guess who they were or what they did that made them so famous. I tried it out on my own and had an absolute blast!
xt3k5h,iqolh43,swaon_dav,2022-10-01 23:07:37,2,even better :)
xt3k5h,iqs029z,swaon_dav,2022-10-02 17:52:30,2,Exactly! :) For those astro nerds who likes such things its a lot of fun. It's not so much who will guess the most but the process and you learn things very quick and I personally love it. Another way to build real bond in a community of fellow minded people: engage them to do something together.

Lots of new grads with zero ICU exposure get hired to the ICU/MICU.  I would keep quiet about it and not mention it at all.  Start orientation.  You didn't misrepresent anything and if an ICU practicum is not required, then you are not required to tell the manager you didn't get any.

6-12 month orientation program sounds fabulous.  You will get what you need from that.  Focus on finishing school and passing NCLEX.  That's where your energy needs to be right now."

There was not one single residency job I applied to that told me my practicum needed to be in their unit. Did they say something that gave you this impression or is it just self-induced stress?"

So being told you have to deny the MICU job due to your university’s failure is stupid. However, if you told your soon-to-be-manager you did or will be doing your capstone in an ICU unit, you might want to share that fell through. I doubt they would rescind the offer though."

A good preceptor/ course curriculum will start with basics and build your knowledge. In my experience as Charge and Precepting, the only time a preceptorship really sets someone up to be ahead of new grads is if they train on the specific unit they are hired on. And even then its mostly knowing where things are, the basics of the charting system, some of their resources and care basics. Your current preceptor sounds not supportive or kind. Just make the best of your experience with them and be honest with your knowledge/ experience when you start. Typically ICU or specialty units are hard to get as students so it is not an expectation when hiring. Good luck on your journey!"

Children ARE different.  They are not little adults.  But they do grow up to become them.

The nursing process is the same regardless of which population you work with.  Basic processes such as med admin are the same.  There are advantages to the way we do things; it means if you find working peds in the hospital (rather than a office practice) is not for you, you have the ability to do something else in nursing.  In some countries (England I think being one) some nursing programs are restricted to a specific specialty (OB for example) meaning you have to do school all over if you want a different type of nursing."

She's asking why train with adults at all when the licensing exam tests you as if you were an adult med surg nurse.  She's not a graduate.  She's a student who works as a medical assistant in a pediatricians office.  That's a far cry from working as a peds nurse to the point of comparing apples to oranges.  So your assumption is incorrect.

I would not argue ICU is the best place to start.  First of all you assume med surg nursing is not capable of being incredibly complex and difficult.  The very point of training and testing on a med surg basis is because that is where most nurses will work and because it is so easy for a med surg patient to go south and require ICU level care.

My first job was med surg oncology.  I learned my path, pharm, time management, and honed my critical skills.  It is the foundation of every other specialty of nursing I've done, from med surg to ER to hospice to cardiac stepdown to corrections and more.  Med Surg is what gives you true flexibility as a nurse."

That would be unmanageable! Check the internship website and review the eligibility criteria. You should contact them if it is not clear and see that you understood things well... by the way, I think that going to the chair to talk about this is quite ill advised if you haven't talked to the internship office first. And even then! It's not like the chair could tell the office to change the rules of the program, could they? Doesn't it take years to make changes to programs at McGill?"

It's McGill's job to facilitate your professional/academic development and nothing except bureaucracy is holding you back. Approach it from that angle, make sure you know going in what the criteria are (i.e. what actually constitutes ""coop"" for the gov't) and ask them to find a way to fulfill those criteria. For instance, if it's just a matter of getting something on your transcript, that should be an easy fix. If you need to be in a dedicated coop program, then that's probably going to be more difficult. If I were you I'd start that process ASAP because not everyone is as responsive as one might hope."

yiseb0,iukfq01,nobody_you_know,2022-11-01 00:28:41,2,"I contacted the archives at WGBH and asked if they had any projects that needed work. They said yes. I ended up inventorying a bunch of original digital tapes of performances at the Lowell Folk Festival. They didn't even know they had them until I cracked that box; it was just in a pile of ""to be sorted"" stuff in storage. It's wasn't glamorous, but it got me into the library job market in New England.

There are *always* projects that need work. You will have the twin virtues of a) knowing something about what you're doing, and b) being inexpensive. The main obstacle will be whether they have someone available to supervise you, but I would expect most libraries would at least consider whether that's something they can accommodate. 

Christ, right now if some new baby librarian came along and said, ""hey, I'd like to organize a big display in conjunction with one or several student organizations, and create promotional materials and a social media outreach campaign to support it,"" we'd be all over that shit. Helpful for us, applicable to public libraries, plus experience and a portfolio piece for you. Win/win/win. That sort of thing, you know?

But yeah, just ask around. You can ask if they have gaps you can address/projects that need work, or you can propose your dream project if they don't. And don't be afraid to aim high. Librarians are generally pretty open to being asked questions. ;)"

yf2cws,iu2wbr8,REMandYEMfan,2022-10-28 03:42:33,11,Your second paragraph should cause you to think twice
yf2cws,iu1eqdt,howtobeawerewolf,2022-10-27 20:54:48,8,"Try to do different activities and see how the students respond, maybe if your sponsor teacher isn’t helpful connect with other teachers and see what kind of strategies they use for engagement. 

If you can get a few students on your side and engaged that can make a huge difference on the rest of the students. 

Consider implementing some kind of incentive program for class participation. Could reward with some kind of token that can be exchanged for a kind of privilege (extensions on assignments, bonus mark on a test, etc….). You could also have a tracking system for participation (I didn’t really like this but one of my sponsor teacher LOVED it). She would reserve 10-15% of a students grade for participation and track it like points on a piece of paper. 

Honestly your sponsor teacher being hands off is not the worst, much better than someone constantly critiquing and questioning you. 

It sounds like you’re confident in your teaching so some general advice would be just to stick with it. Keep the effort up and the student will appreciate it, even though it seems pointless. I finished my practicum two years ago and it was by far the hardest teaching experience I have had. You can do it !!!!"
yf2cws,iu1rhiz,myDogStillLovesMe,2022-10-27 22:24:12,7,"Welcome to teaching! You are discovering that, just like every walk of life, there is admin and staff drama. There are so many different personalities, different approaches to teaching, it's what makes it so compelling. I can look at the way my colleagues are teaching and think ""it's not for me, but I can see the value in their system"" and some of them, I see screaming and angry all the time, and I wonder how they are still employed.

Just find teachers that share your core beliefs and keep in touch with them. Get through your B Ed and carve your own path."
yf2cws,iu23lca,GargoyleLyra,2022-10-27 23:57:40,5,"You haven't choosen the wrong career. I work in a lot of inner city schools where kids are very difficult. Poverty, depression, behavioural issues. (I was actually threatened with a chair once and even hit several times. Some students have even sworn at me.) The most important thing is to often stop and talk about their feelings. Acknowledge how they feel and let them know that it's okay to have those feelings. 

I suggest doing a community circle at the beginning of the day. Check in with them to see how they are emotionally. Do they require food or rest? Do they need to have a calming moment? Another activity you could do is a zone activity: blue (sad, scared etc), red (angry, yelling voice etc) yellow (scared, nervous, tired etc), green (happy, excited, focused). There are lots of pdf files you can find for this activity. Then, as a transition, you can do a community circle and ask what zone they're in. 

Additionally, get to know the students. What are some things they like. (Pokemon are huge in schools these days) and bring it into the lesson. Like, do a Pokemon hunt as a treat. Or have them make their own pokemon during art class."
yf2cws,iu1tlnq,Roadi1120,2022-10-27 22:40:18,3,"This is normal, student look at highschool as a means to an end, they are just trying to get through it. I teach tech at a highschool and flat out my students come in and want to go right to shop to avoid theory. So I just do my theory on the floor with activities and demo’s it works well they are all progressing. Depending what you are teaching make it activities with theory built in. I had 7/8 students do the penny boat challenge I explained theory and formulas pertaining to it. They engaged well and actually used the math once they realized they can beat each other."
yf2cws,iu4dm32,gillsaurus,2022-10-28 13:47:35,3,"You’ve just stepped into a teaching landscape that has changed significantly in the last couple years. At risk children already come with a host of social-emotional, mental, and behavioural issues, but across the board there’s been a decline in engagement and behaviour. It is due to the pandemic but also heavily compounded by social media absolutely obliterating attention spans and connections. 

I graduated a decade ago, am 8 years into actively teaching, and the last 2 years destroyed me mentally and emotionally that I’m questioning my passion."
yf2cws,iu6u832,Ebillydog,2022-10-29 00:14:44,3,"It may not be the inner city thing. There are issues generally in most schools now with kids who have had their schooling disrupted multiple times over the past 3 years. Generally, you can expect that students will behave about 3 grade levels younger, and the disconnect comes from online learning, where they could walk out of the room whenever they wanted, play video games and snack during class, and not turn things in without much consequences. Many students are struggling with having to do 5 hours of school a day, not being able to access their electronics continuously, and having to do paper and pen when they are used to keyboards and mice. Many of them also have a social skills deficit from lack of socialization opportunities, and lack understanding of classroom etiquette. Even experienced teachers are struggling with students who are disengaged and disrespectful. I've been having to teach my middle school students basic primary level skills like how to walk through the halls without disrupting other classes, not talking while the teacher is talking, and how to put paper into a duotang, and I'm not teaching in an inner city school.

About your teacher being less knowledgeable about the subject material, it is common for teachers to have to teach subjects they are not experts in, but they can still be good teachers. And you can be an expert at doing a subject, but crappy at teaching it. It doesn't matter that your teaching styles are different, you can still learn from her. And as a newbie teacher, you probably don't even know what your teaching style is yet. I thought I knew, and then I started working as teacher and discovered that when you are alone in charge of a classroom, things are very very different than when you are doing a practicum where someone else has your back and is taking care of all of the things outside of lesson planning."
yf2cws,iu2okk7,Coopernicus17,2022-10-28 02:37:51,2,"Honestly, you’ll never get them all. We try, knowing we won’t always succeed. It’s incredibly frustrating a lot of the time being and educator… but the ones you do get, we inspire passion in. You’d probably enjoy being in a IB school or higher income area.

I’m at a school like that now, and I miss the inner city school I was at. It takes an immense amount of understanding and patience with students at time… but also, would you care about most of the subjects in high school if you had zero belief in your future, no dreams, and were just trying to make it through the day? Welcome to some public schools. That is why your mentor teacher is a coach. They probably also wear 30 other hats throughout the year."
yf2cws,iu4gjp8,Emotional-Ad2365,2022-10-28 14:09:01,2,"You are new to teaching so you are just starting to learn this, but not every class that you teach is going to check off all your teacher boxes, especially in high school. Remember that it’s just a job, do what you can with the time that you have, try new things and if they don’t go well don’t dismiss it just modify and try again. You will have both very high and VERY low moments throughout the years but do not take it personally! That’s the best way to crush a teachers spirit"
yf2cws,iu1v2n9,loncal200,2022-10-27 22:51:46,2,"You may have chosen the wrong career. Only you can know that. You are getting a taste of what your career is going to be like. You will be working with lots/lots of kids who are lacking basic skills. If they have an IEP you will also have to modify and accommodate for them as well as teach the others at grade level. Remember just because you care about the subject matter doesn't mean they do - they just have to take it and pass. I've know kids who only come to school so they can play school sports. The rest is noise.

It's tough and I've been teaching over a decade and still struggle with it. You will have kids that you will not be able to reach ( could be personal or academic reasons) and you will have colleagues that you will not see eye-to-eye with - it might even be your admin. It might be someone you have to co-teach with.

Just remember if you make it through this you will be more prepared for your first ever job. I too did not get along with one of my AT and I thought she was cold and stuck on things being 'perfect'. It was disheartening to trug through but it also is better to experience it now than get a shock when your in first job and totally unprepared."
yf2cws,iu1dhco,MentalGymnist23,2022-10-27 20:46:40,1,"I'm feeling very similar in my practicum too. I'm also in an inner city and my teacher is giving me so many mixed messages that I can't confidently say I know what I'm doing and my confidence is really shifty. I'm also positive she's using me as a way to get back at kids who bother her (e.g. I've seen her let students act a certain way during my observation but she expects me to come down on them when I'm teaching a lesson.) She is also one to be two-faced (as are all the rest of the faculty) so I can't trust her at all nor anyone else teaching the subject. It also doesn't help that she doesn't respect students preferred names and pronouns ONLY behind their backs. 

I would also love to know if this non-sense is the norm for working environments in schools now."

My program professor who observes me says I'm doing great, but my sponsor teacher is all over me. It's exhausting. I appreciate the encouragement and advice!"
yf2cws,iu2voqb,sehaugust,2022-10-28 03:36:55,3,Thank youuuuu. This helps. I think I'm just having a really hard tumble to earth in terms of experiencing the realities of teaching vs the ideals.
yf2cws,iu2w1o3,sehaugust,2022-10-28 03:40:05,2,"Honestly students seem pretty guarded and resistant to letting me get to know them, which is discouraging but I probably should have expected that. I think I had this idea that we'd click and it would all go seamlessly because I'm naive/optimistic and passionate about my subject. The reality is... they don't know me. Don't know why they should trust me or even listen to me, beyond not wanting to get in trouble. It feels more like being a youth worker than a Teacher but again, naive of me to expect otherwise."
yf2cws,iu6zet5,sehaugust,2022-10-29 00:56:25,1,This is an amazingly in-depth and helpful comment. Thank you so so much! I agree with all of it. I'm definitely learning a lot on this practicum- just in a different way than i expected.
yf2cws,iu2ruk6,sehaugust,2022-10-28 03:04:00,0,You nailed it. Especially about my mentor teacher. She's been in the school for almost 20 years and does a lot.

yf2cws,iuget17,REMandYEMfan,2022-10-31 03:01:03,3,"No. You said that you were a gifted student and as such, you have a hard time teaching because your students are lacking basic skills. 

Your job is to meet the students where they’re at, and to build on their skills. 

The attitude that comes through your writing shows that you may benefit on some self reflection."
yf2cws,iu29mxo,Mysterious_Piece5532,2022-10-28 00:43:47,10,"You should listen to your AT. From one BEd student to another: I regret not doing this in my first practicum. Got a horrible evaluation full of backhanded comments. It didn’t matter that the kids loved me. It didn’t matter that my practicum professor said my lessons were great. And also, I was so preoccupied seeing what was wrong, I never saw what was right in regards to my AT’s methods. 

You’ll learn more in your next placements. 

To connect to the kids get to know their interests. In my class I did that by asking questions, having discussions, and co-constructing classroom management practices. For example, I had a goofy call-back that I suggested and the class loved. They would beg me to bring the class to attention using the call-back “scooby dooby doo” song. 

I also taught them a new gym game they loved so much we didn’t play much else."
yf2cws,iu2co0g,AwarenessSure9012,2022-10-28 01:06:50,5,"God, I had a horrible mentor teacher in my second placement, so I can relate. I would be forward and ask them what it is that they’re looking to see from you. Document that and then try to implement it - you want to avoid a bad review from them in any way that you can. Your next placement will probably be much better!"
yf2cws,iu40tai,myDogStillLovesMe,2022-10-28 12:00:44,2,I hear you! The great thing is that you can keep many of your ideals and put them into action when you have your own classroom / subject. It can be so rewarding to hear from students or parents how much of a difference you have made.
yf2cws,iu4dnvq,GargoyleLyra,2022-10-28 13:47:56,3,"Trust me, in those schools you do play more of a youth worker than an actual teacher. It's not uncommon for them to be hesitant. Kids in inner city schools are the toughest kids. Ask them questions, talk with them, say what you like (child friendly of course), have them write jokes for you."
yf2cws,iulbqae,sehaugust,2022-11-01 05:13:09,1,"Sorry, I realize how that sounds - I should have been more clear. When I say I was a gifted student, I mean that I deal with all the pitfalls of so-called giftedness, which means big lows whenever I perceive personal failure, a fear of failure that creates a static mindset, and a need to be creatively challenged and deal with interesting problem-solving or I get bored, depressed, and quit whatever I'm doing. It's been a big barrier in terms of long-term career success. I always feel behind. So when I'm dealing with students who don't have basic skills, and I try to help them develop those but they resist or don't get it, I feel like I'm failing them hugely. And then i feel like I'm a terrible teacher, and then I start thinking I should quit. It's a spiral of ""if I'm not succeeding, I'm failing"". But I'm beginning to understand that teaching is more about moving through the failures and celebrating the wins. Thanks for your feedback."

ya93c5,it9w5j5,None,2022-10-22 00:27:34,6,"Hi, I'm not sure where you are located but it seems normal based on where I am located in the states. 

In my experience, I was assigned clients by the practicum site and I reached out to my clients via email to schedule our sessions. They also provided an office space for me to use. 

Of course the first client and session is going to be a bit nerve wracking. Don't overthink it. The client is going to enter and they are going to start talking to you, hopefully. Tune into how you think they are feeling about what they are talking about and ask exploratory questions about what you are curious about. Then you can meet with your supervisor in the week and discuss how you felt about the meeting. If you have any questions about anything, ask your supervisor. Some supervisors will provide their contact information, so that you can call in case of an emergency. 

My first client and session? I am laughing and remembering an older man storm into my dingy office and he immediately asked me, ""how old are you?!"" 

It was very unsettling and I felt anxious. I worked with him for a year and I grew to understand that he was often anxious and feeling very uncertain about ageing. The countertransference that I felt in that moment, helped me understand what he was going through. 

In the moment I surely stumbled and I told him my true age without asking him what was behind him asking. Nowadays, I would surely ask to explore the motivation behind such a questions. But the small mistake didn't cause that much of a problem. He kept coming back every week to talk to me. He was often unpleasant. But that is the work."

ua4s2y,i5xav0r,Nsekiil,2022-04-23 21:29:28,10,Ok but half the class would chose mother baby and that isn’t feasible
ua4s2y,i5wkkwy,zeatherz,2022-04-23 18:10:34,10,"There’s simply not enough clinical spots for everyone to get their choice. How many people would actually choose med surg? Even though that’s the vast majority of placement spots available. Almost everyone would want their specialty and be disappointed when they don’t get it.

That’s said, my school did let us pick our top three units, preferred site out of three hospitals and preferred shift. No one got all their preferences, and the instructors made the decision based on your performance throughout school (low grades and poor clinical/lab performance wouldn’t get ICU or ER for example)."
ua4s2y,i5w7qg7,BenzieBox,2022-04-23 16:36:42,8,The lack of experience in specialties sounds more like low availability of placements. Just because a hospital exists and has a labor and delivery unit doesn’t mean they will/can accept students on the floor. They aren’t obligated and it’s a liability the hospital has to take to have unlicensed students on the floor.
ua4s2y,i5vhbjo,ShadedSpaces,2022-04-23 13:12:34,20,"Unfortunately, schools can barely get these practicum placements to begin with. Most programs aren’t being withholding on purpose, it’s just that they don’t have tons of options. They take what they can get and it’s set up in advance of the nursing students even knowing what they like. 

Also plenty of schools are doing away with practicum. It’s not really that useful. They hype it up like “it’s when you’ll really learn to be a nurse, blah blah blah,” buuuuut it’s not. 

I knew from day 1 of my ABSN that I wanted peds critical care. For clinicals, I got two semesters on the same med-surg ortho floor. LOATHED it. For practicum, I basically begged for anything peds or anything critical care. I got… med-surg ortho. I tried very hard to make the most of it, but it was 100% useless and I learned nothing. And guess what? Didn’t matter. Had zero impact on my life. 

I got into a competitive residency with a specialized pediatric critical care unit as my unit of hire. NOTHING about practicum mattered. At all. And it wouldn’t have changed anything if I’d gotten what I wanted for practicum either. 

It’s just something to get through. Everything that matters is beyond school."
ua4s2y,i5vzwmh,None,2022-04-23 15:39:13,23,">This is seemingly an unpopular opinion.

It's not unpopular, it's just entitled and entirely ignorant of what goes into placing students.  There are zero hospitals out there that are 100% eager and full of energy, time, and money to cater to student whims when the entire healthcare industry is teetering on the brink all of the time.  Students are lucky as hell to get any placements at all right now, given how difficult it is to retain staff nurses and how stressful it is to add the incredibly heavy burden of a student into a busy shift, much less to do it for weeks at a time.  You're arguing from the position of the squeaky, broken wheel when the cart has four other quiet, fully-functioning wheels already on it and is going past a ""Will pay cash for broken wheels"" dump in the next half mile.  Hospital placements have *always* been a challenge for schools because of how much of a burden taking students is on nurses, IT, administration, and everybody else trying to keep the hospital running, but to come in during COVID and say, ""I'm not happy with what I'm getting, I think we should all get to dictate where we go based on what's fun for us""?  That is *really* out of touch with what's going on."
ua4s2y,i5vo70a,doodynutz,2022-04-23 14:10:37,3,My ABSN program doesn’t even get a practicum.
ua4s2y,i5w5k93,doodlesanddonuts,2022-04-23 16:20:42,3,"Wow that's dumb, especially because new grad programs for ICU and some other units require you to have IP experience. We get to choose, but the unit has to accept you and then professors have to think you'll be okay. If you choose ICU and you have bad grades or get stressed about things easily you will not be getting your chosen spot. We're lucky that there are multiple hospitals in the area so there are usually enough preceptors to go around. I honestly would not have gone to my school if we couldn't choose."
ua4s2y,i5xv6iq,Tripindipular,2022-04-24 00:09:38,3,How the hell is school making students work Night Shift??
ua4s2y,i5wbkyl,vanilla_iceee,2022-04-23 17:04:42,5,"Ironically I was just observing in the pediatric ER this past week and the nurse I was with was super helpful and knowledgeable and taught me a lot it tips and advice. One thing she told me when I asked her why everyone recommends starting on Med-Surg was

 “I’m old school but I seriously think everyone should start night shift and med-surg. You have half the staff and there’s maybe 2 attendings to everyone and you learn to prioritize care and use your resources real fast when three of your patients start declining or having issues at the same time. I started night shift med-surg in adult world and wouldnt be the nurse I am today without experiences like that.” 

I’m also someone that would prefer a pediatric floor, operating room, etc. but hearing someone explain it to me like that made a lot more sense and much more valuable than everyone just telling me to pay your dues to med-surg which made it sound like it was the equivalent of me having to carry the water jug every day to soccer practice freshman year. So unrelated to your question but there is some value to be found in med-surg. 

Also in regard to how your school only seems to put you on med-surg floors, that may be all that’s available for you guys to use like other people have been saying because a lot of that depends on what the hospital is willing to give for precepting and clinical floors in general. So that also can depend on the area you’re in and what hospitals you have available."

The exposure was great, but the best part was networking with the staff. My first day employed I already knew 8 physicians and and 12 nurse and surgical assists. So anytime I had questions and couldn't get help on my home unit I had friends I could call."

I wanted ED and got ED.

My friend wanted critical care and got PCU.

My other friend wanted peds or maternity and got some rando adult floor. They just couldn’t do it. But they did try.

I did have varied rotations too.  I did med surg, rehab, OB (maternity, L&D, antepartum and post partum), and a trauma/burn step down unit that I actually accepted a job at.  Some people got PCU, cardiac step downs, etc.

Our last rotation was supposed to be a PCU but ever nurse on the floor quit and they closed the floor down 😬.  And we got shoved to some random obs/med surg floor so that sucked.  But I’m still graduating, baby!!! So it’s all good.

Where you go on clinical just depends on your teachers.  Sounds like your school needs to recruit more varied instructors.  But that, truly, is easier said than done!"

In one of the, hands down, most brilliant moves of any of my nursing instructors - I submitted Oncology as my choice.  She didn’t give it to me.  She put me on an in patient Hospice unit, and told me if I could handle that, I could handle oncology.  I started my nursing career in Oncology with a major head start on addressing death and dying."
ua4s2y,i5xdwj7,21pilotsAttheDisco,2022-04-23 21:52:59,2,"I'll say now that i've worked a year and a half that the choosing of the practicum is awesome. I was able to let my school know that i was interested in the rough area of town (unique area in my city) with a ton of mental health, addictions, trauma... as a mental health nursing student. I then found out that my placement had a crap ton of cool programs in the primary care clinic, and got to rotate into each area and ultimately fell in love with the nursing there, and have made the connections to work there now! 

I will say though, some nurses think they want something but aren't a match. And I think it would benefit to do sort of a phone call or video interview maybe with a potential preceptor for like, 15 mins to get a jist of specialty areas, and to figure out if that's what they want to pursue. Or maybe some sort of an orientation video to show what the department entails? I also was fortunate enough that my site has a great orientation for new hires on the unit and I was able to do all these educational courses beforehand to prepare myself. I am a firm believer in if you really want to try something, and do the education and work to learn it, you should absolutely get that experience. It's just a matter of if the department/program is setting you up for success or not."
ua4s2y,i5xir25,MedicalCoconut,2022-04-23 22:30:48,2,"I know my school allows you to rank your unit choices, but due to limited preceptors there is no guarantee as to what unit you will end up on. 

The one caveat to this is we have three certification programs you can apply to separately (Adult crit care, Maternal child crit care and advanced med surg). If you're in one of these programs you are guaranteed a placement in that field (So maternal child is guaranteed NICU/L&D/Peds ICU (You rank those when you apply), Adult is ICU/ED and Med Surg is specialties such as IV team or Wound care (following the first half being on a normal MS Unit)). The program is mega limited (only 6 seats in each per semester), and you have to have the GPA/Interview/Essay and sample paper from the semester to get in, but it does give options."

As a side note I got into nursing education many years ago by the director of the program. She called me and asked if I had ever considered being an educator, because I was (according to her) the most requested preceptor at our local hospital for several years.

What it actually sounds like you graduated in a time/place where appropriate orientation upon hire was lacking. 

Because what you’re saying is that nurses need appropriate orientation to their role before being on their own. Which I totally agree with. 

But the *only* practical place to have that orientation is on the unit of hire. Practicum is not designed to do that. Because it throws you on a random floor and you can’t choose what it is. 

I had a 20-week orientation when I was hired (and a concurrent year-long residency.) THAT is where I was appropriately trained to care for critically ill neonates (and some older kiddos) on ECMO, getting bedside surgery, **not** an adult med-surg ortho floor where five different nurses precepted me over 8 shifts.

If I have a noon med pass and a q4h CIWA due by 1300, I have to get those done before taking a lunch. Only thing we can't give is blood, TPN, and IVP narcs.

We also chart all I&O for the 12 hour shift, all lines/tubes/drains, pain assessments and reassessments, make nursing notes when we communicate an issue to our primary nurse or perform an order/skill like PIV insertion or Foley removal. It has taught us a lot of time management and feels kinda like a real 12 hour shift. It's exhausting but I think it's valuable and kinda feels like a practicum 🤷"

But what does putting someone in a floor they have zero interest in (after having all previous clinical sights in med Surg) and all the interest in something they have 15+ years of experience in (emergency medicine/flight medic in military). Genuinely curious. My belief is it turns people off from nursing… because that’s what it’s doing for me.

Sometimes, there just aren't many teaching hospitals in the area. Some hospitals/units refused students during covid and haven't rewelcomed them. Others may be struggling to train their own new grads after seeing their senior staff switch to traveling.

A student committee could work with administration to appeal to local hospitals to accept students. But that's not likely to be a quick fix.

We can however get checked off at clinical to D/C Foley's and PIVs without supervision when ordered/discharge orders are in. But we have to check the orders in the EMR, let our nurse know, and chart all the pieces necessary and a note about our actions. 

While our program isn't perfect, it's not bad. We got an ICU day as well which was nice, I hear on the thread it's been rough getting anything but MS. Other than that one ICU day, I've been on a MS Ortho/Neuro floor this whole time. My current floor is now taking step down trauma patients as overflow, which is a change (but hard on the nurses). They get wired jaws and chest tubes recently, it's interesting. We have to do EMR training for whatever facility we go to and set up student accounts with the hospital so they know a student is charting. It's a lot more work for students but it's good because the instructors can check our charting and correct things that need correcting."

In the US we have a fraction of the training hours that nursing students do in other countries, and as it is now school is teaching you how to be safe in a healthcare setting and laying the groundwork for critical thinking. It’s unfortunately not setting you up to be a  nurse who is ready to work independently without months of additional training"

xl4bwd,iphgm41,gscrap,2022-09-22 16:11:04,24,"Yes, it's always difficult to provide therapy when it's clear that therapy isn't a client's most urgent need.  It's great that you had a team that was able to come together and offer some practical resources, so I hope that was helpful for your client, but of course just because therapy isn't what your client needs most doesn't mean that it can't still be helpful for them.

Your colleague who did some grounding had a good idea.  When a client is in crisis, it's often best not to overload them with work that is too deep or complicated.  Recognizing and accepting and/or managing emotions in the moment are great, basic strategies that are applicable in almost every situation.  It's a perfect place to start once the immediate crisis has been addressed.

Beyond that, once the client's emotions have stabilized, I think it's a good idea to check in with the their ideas and goals for the session.  Recognizing that, although the practical food issue is the primary concern, there might not be more that can be done about it in session and exploring other ways the client might use the time.  Something like ""We've generated some ideas together for how you can resolve the immediate food crisis, which you're going to pursue when we're done here today.  Are there any more thoughts you want to explore around that, or would you rather move on to something else with the rest of our time?""  

Unspoken in the question (but depending on the nature of your work together, you might actually speak it) is whether the client wants to end the session early so they can hit the food bank as soon as possible.  Sometimes when a crisis (or hunger pangs) is feeling particularly urgent, there's just not much you can do in therapy and it would be appropriate to cut the session short.  As a sidenote, I keep some plain, nut-free granola bars in my office for clients in the rare circumstance that they want to be in the therapy session but are too hungry to focus.  Depending on your approach, philosophy and work parameters, that might be an appropriate option for the occasional times that it will come up.

If the client doesn't have any ideas for what they want to do in therapy, but don't want to leave either, and if there isn't some appropriate matter to return to from our ongoing work together, I'd probably suggest something out of the Acceptance & Commitment Therapy playbook, maybe looking at the client's values and how they are able to express and inhabit those values even in extraordinarily difficult situations like limited access to necessities."
xl4bwd,ipi9a7d,None,2022-09-22 19:10:07,7,"I'm not a therapist but a crisis counselor and similar situations are not uncommon to encounter in crisis counseling.  After the precipitating problem as been identified (in this case, food insecurity) and resources have been given, sometimes it might be appropriate to just end there.  If the client has gotten to the root of exactly what they need and that need is physiological - like food, or sleep, or medical care - I'd ask them if they feel supported enough end the session so they can get that immediately.  

For example, in talking with a mother who was feeling erratic due to exhaustion, once we identified that she really needs to get some rest, we put a plan together to make that happen, and I didn't push her to continue the session if she really just wanted to go home and sleep. 

In most crisis situations, the goal is to get the person to a more empowered, higher level of functioning than when they sat down.  I would explore their current level of coping, and offer to collaborate with them on coming up with ways they can cope with their immediate situation - both on their own and within their family or community.  I'd use lots of empowering and supportive statements with this person, exploring their strengths and what has worked for them in the past.  Typically, when the crisis is stemming from an institutional or socio-economic hardship (ie, poverty), I avoid educational and reframing statements - people don't like to be educated on their own hardships, especially by a person who experiences more privilege.  I think the grounding exercise was a good idea, and could be presented as something this person could do by themselves in the future."
xl4bwd,iphyqmv,Phoolf,2022-09-22 18:03:45,5,"My background is working with women and children from disadvantaged backgrounds and as such I have resources for onward signposting and referrals and know the limits of what can be done in therapy when basic needs are not being met. Offering resources, offering to support people to phone them if too anxious etc is part of good practice to me. When you come across a learning opportunity like this it's a good opportunity to get to grips with practical, local referral pathways."
xl4bwd,iphn2ja,existdetective,2022-09-22 16:51:03,7,"This situation is an opportunity to reflect on your economic & educational privilege (maybe racial privilege as well). With that kind of reflective practice, you will see opportunities arise in these situations to explore client’s experience of being helped with necessities in a therapy setting. 

Could you imagine the various ways a person might feel after the crisis passes? Perhaps ashamed or “less than” or even resentful of you & your colleagues for the fact that you don’t likely struggle in the same way… and might this then impact client attendance or behavior in therapy, her feelings of trust that her experience can be understood by you? 

And how is it for you to stand witness to the enormous systemic barriers faced by clients? To know that you have so much privilege & power relative to them? And to cope with your own outrage at the system for how it hurts your clients? 

There are big implications here & I encourage you to take them to supervision & unpack all this before seeing the client again."

xl4bwd,iphr1ki,Mariewn,2022-09-22 17:15:43,6,"Thank you. I have been politically active on the left and worked in the nonprofit sector for a while before pursuing a career in therapy. However, due to my privilege, I have never really witnessed up close and personal someone being so screwed by our political and economic system. I was really sad, and angry seeing this client who is working so hard (a lot harder than most) and has been able to overcome so many challenges suffering from these injustices. This experience definitely increased my understanding on how these systemic issues impact individuals directly. 

Thank you for posing these questions to help me better reflect on this before the next session. I certainly don’t want to further the trauma and pain this person is experiencing which as you said could easily be done by a well intentioned therapist who has not personally been in this circumstance or properly reflected on its implications in a therapeutic setting. 

Edit: grammar, clarity"
xl4bwd,iphzpkh,existdetective,2022-09-22 18:09:55,4,"Really appreciate your reply & grateful to “meet” another therapist who wonders about systemic oppression’s impacts on clients *and* on the  client-therapist relationship. 

Some therapists claim that those other things are not appropriately part of therapy. I can’t get on board with that at all. A client’s experience of systemic oppression impacts their ability to meet their own basic needs for **safety**, shelter, food, & health care (including accessing therapy *and therapists who get this part of their lives*).  It also causes incredible stress & is likely braided with trauma experiences of that oppression and other traumatic events/conditions in their lives. 

And then the therapist inevitably *represents* many things for a client. And I’m not just talking about a Freudian thing here about our mothers! We can also represent all or some of the people of our race/class/gender/etc within clients’ lives, some of whom have been allies & some of whom were definitely not. And there is inequitable power to the relationship even if we match our client in every dimension. All of this matters. 

Acknowledging this & knowing when/how to address it within a clinical scope of practice is *the single trickiest aspect of our work*. A therapist can deny that & refuse to do the work to better manage it, but doing so puts you at odds with current research & theory in our field. 

People who aren’t doing the personal & professional work of wrestling with privilege are harmful  to clients; unfortunately by nature of their power & privilege they will never get investigated or reprimanded. 

So I’m getting downvoted for my original comment. *Whatever* .  This isn’t about being “woke”; it’s about ethical practice."

Thus, a practicum would never have been able to require this in my program as the program itself never made it a requirement (doesn’t matter if it was a prac requirement, you still got program credits for it and as such the prac had to abide by said rules too). It’s also unclear to me, did you even require the student to do it or just strongly rec it? If not explicitly stated as required to pass the prac I feel the correct response is to not bring it up… you didn’t require it.

In contrast, I was not required to be in therapy during my master's program, and did not attend therapy, and I had no idea what I was doing when I made it to graduation.

If it's a requirement, you might have consequences like not allowing them to use this experience on their resume, not signing completion forms for the university, etc. 

If it's a request, you might address it as a potential growth area for the student. Either the student is disorganized and was unable to put together an appointment (which is a problem for a future professional) or they were actively avoiding the assignment (and should be encouraged to reflect on why)."
xfs4tw,iooxacj,logdemon,2022-09-16 17:35:52,6,"I was a student like this, and I had been to therapy only once or twice before starting my program. I think approaching it from the angle of you have to deal with your own stuff, know how it feels to be on the other end of the therapeutic relationship as a client, and to normalize this as a self-care practice for new clinicians is going to be really vital for this field. I had all kinds of reasons why I was putting it off, mostly socioeconomic (I was working two jobs while going to my grad program), But I also have/had severe family trauma, and I was burnt out from these reasons and my unchecked symptoms getting the better of me. Help students approach not only barriers to treatment but as barriers to the work they’re doing, and you’ll help them do the same for clients down the road."
xfs4tw,ioqxgjy,moonbeam127,2022-09-17 02:19:33,2,"Possibly this practicum student has been in therapy previously and under no obligation to share those details with you.  The simple answer of 'ill get to it' should be enough.  If someone kept reminding me every 4-6 weeks about an OPTIONAL service I would become quite upset and possibly alert my university coordinator know of the situation.

There is nothing to address with the student.  They are a student placement and a university student at this point.  They are not your employee and I am not aware of any code of conduct or ethics that requires mandatory counseling for students.

You can not force a student to disclose past therapy and you can not force a student to partake in therapy that you pay for.  For all you know they are currently in therapy, again something they are under no obligation to share with you, the university, the licensing board or anyone else."
xfs4tw,ioric3q,STEMpsych,2022-09-17 05:40:27,2,"I think this task is reasonable, but I also think there's a bunch of reasonable reasons the student might not do it, and since it wasn't a requirement, that's a choice they get to make.

I wanted to add, personally, I have a sore spot about academic (and professional) environments where ""suggestions"" and ""requests"" are covert orders.  Whether it's an ""optional assignment"" that you can't get a decent grade without or an ""understanding"" that though the nominal workday is 9-5 everyone will always work late, it's bullshit.  If it's not a requirement, it's not a requirement.

That said, the fact that the task the student didn't do is get therapy does open the question of whether the student has some bad attitudes about therapy and/or therapy clients that perhaps need addressing.  The program I went through shared some classes with a guidance counseling program, and in one of my classes during the discussions of what a good idea it was that counselors get therapy, one of the guidance counseling students took some umbrage at the proposal.  In the ensuing class discussion, he betrayed some very negative attitudes about therapy and the people who get it: that therapy is only for crazy or weak people, that there's something contemptible about people who get (""need"") therapy, and he wasn't anybody like *that*.  In short, psychiatric ableism.  Pretty eyebrow raising stuff to show up in a Theories of Psychotherapy survey course.  I have no idea if there was any sort of follow up for him of that.

> This year, one student just never got around to doing the session.

It sounds like you don't actually know that.  The student didn't do it, but may have had actually *decided* not to do it – and just didn't let you in on that decision.  If you have actual reason to believe that the student was in some sense *negligent* – the student told you they intended to do it, or espoused that they wanted to do it, and then *failed* to do it due to flakiness or poor time management, then that might be something to address in a supportive way. ""Hey, was this something you had wanted to take advantage of and didn't get around to?  Or had you just decided to give it a pass?""

It doesn't sound like you're in a great position to disambiguate the possibilities here."

Yes, I unde that it was not a requirement but only a suggestion, but the waiving off signaled an intention to comply, so I would treat this as an opportunity to examine what barriers came up and discuss the reasons why there was such a suggestion to begin with, looking for more buy in while having an eye for resistance.

My program didn't require therapy, but it was assumed we were in therapy or had been in therapy before, and students discussed the epistemic and social justice issues involved in providing therapy one has never received. I think it should have been required, but the culture encouraged and supported it enough. I'm skeptical of framing it as a personal choice though, so I would want to understand issues that prevented a therapy student from seeking therapy and would want to get on the same page."

If it is a voluntary option, though, it needs to be **truly voluntary**, which means that the student can choose to not do it without consequence. 

Three or four reminders in six months feels like a lot of reminders to me for something voluntary. In my opinion, at the most, one additional conversation might be reasonable. E.g., ""Last time we talked, it sounded like you might still be interested in taking advantage of our reimbursed three session therapy benefit. I am asking now since I want to make sure you have time to do it if you want to. Is that something that you're still interested in doing, or have you decided against it? [If they still want to do it: What sort of support, if any, would you like to help make that happen?]

>Apart from some other similar issues with this student (forgetting to follow through on tasks)

This feels to me like it should be addressed completely separately. 

I am also on the APA ethics code, which would not appear to me to allow completion of psychotherapy to be a practicum requirement unless very clearly disclosed as mandatory, with that potentially needing to come from the program itself (under *7.02 - Descriptions of Education and Training Programs*, which requires any mandatory therapy to be clearly described and easy to find if it is required, and *7.04 - Student Disclosure of Personal Information*, which does not allow psychologists to require students to disclose, among other things, their history of or current psychological treatment unless required by the program and clearly described in program materials or necessary to protect the safety of clients. *7.05 - Mandatory Individual or Group Therapy*, is also relevant, but more about who is allowed to provide therapy that is mandated by a program-- which doesn't seem like an issue here since they can choose anyone and presumably no one affiliated with the program or training site is providing psychotherapy to trainees.)."
xfs4tw,ioo7n2i,Sojournancy,2022-09-16 14:50:55,3,"Right - yes I think I used request and requirement interchangeably but you’re right, it is a request to enhance their learning and they don’t absolutely need it to meet the requirements of the program."
xfs4tw,iooallr,Sojournancy,2022-09-16 15:10:16,2,"Nope just to clarify - it’s an opportunity, not required. I think I was just curious about how other professionals would view it and if they would bring it up if it wasn’t done. Personally I’d be all over that opportunity - sessions paid for with the therapist of my choosing. I see it as awesome. But I can understand that some might see it as a burden."
xfs4tw,iopbohn,Sojournancy,2022-09-16 19:10:01,2,"That conversation could spark some interesting dialogue perhaps on what could potentially stop clients from accessing therapy as well - which could be valuable learning. Maybe this intern was too busy, too tired, fearful of what they’d uncover, unsure of what they’d talk about, all issues that clients would also face. 

Definitely see the merit in discussing what happened with curiosity!"
xfs4tw,iop1w31,Sojournancy,2022-09-16 18:05:41,2,Thank you for this! That’s a very helpful perspective!
xfs4tw,ioynhe2,Sojournancy,2022-09-18 18:52:08,1,"Thank you for this feedback! 

The 3-4 time reminder (if it was that) wasn’t pestering by any means - the student met with the supervisor for 1-hour supervision twice a week so it was introduced as an option in one and then expanded on in another (giving more details) then reminded a couple times midway and toward the end, again as a learning opportunity. I wouldn’t be too comfortable with making therapy a requirement of a student only because it could be triggering, they might
Already be involved in therapy, and any number of
Personal reasons why it probably shouldn’t be forced."
xfs4tw,iopc5l8,logdemon,2022-09-16 19:13:12,2,"Of course, I was really angry in my program no one seemed to “get it” as a first generation college student and I know that I don’t know this student’s reasonings, but I think framing it around their work which they’re clearly interested in if they’re getting that far can make a lot of difference for someone. Good luck!"
x45d5l,imtd46y,mesopeachyyy,2022-09-02 16:31:41,19,"Support groups. Find some near client.
Allow them to grieve. There’s a book called Helping Grieving People Grieve.
Talk about the multiple losses, such as loss of future plans, loss of role as a mother, etc.
What topics does client want to discuss? 
Journal. At some point people journal to their loved one. Anything from a ‘see ya later letter’ to a letter that is more like a conversation (guess what I saw today…). 
Review expectations, does this person feel that other expect to be at a certain place in regards to grief? 
Normalize that grief will always be present.
Ball and Box analogy. Google it."
x45d5l,imtfp2s,bedlamunicorn,2022-09-02 16:48:16,9,I would recommend reading about the [dual process model of grief](https://whatsyourgrief.com/dual-process-model-of-grief/). Megan Divine’a “It’s Ok That You’re Not OK” might be another book to check out; it wont necessarily give you a therapy game plan but can give you good insight into grieving.
x45d5l,imtrsvu,stegosaurss,2022-09-02 18:07:07,5,"[David Kessler](https://grief.com/about-david-kessler/) is a great resource for grief. My favorite piece of advice of his is to use the deceased's name. Many times after passing, the dead are often referred to as ""my son/husband/him."" 

Giving them space to feel the grief and recognizing that they don't have to have a timeline is also a good approach. Many of my grief sessions are just allowing space for tears to fall, so someone can see their pain. Grief is isolating."
x45d5l,imulu3v,Constant_Wish3599,2022-09-02 21:30:56,3,"When working with grieving clients I try to remind myself that there is literally no “fixing” this (in the sense that you can’t bring the person back) and I found that very freeing. Just stay focused on companioning them on this journey (Dr. Wolfelt’s tenants), allowing them space to talk about their person. I second all the other resources mentioned here."
x45d5l,imvyzgu,MediocrePast,2022-09-03 04:09:23,3,"You’ve already gotten some great advice here, I think the main thing I’d want to add/emphasize is to learn (and be able to discuss with this client) about varying models/theories surrounding grief outside of the 5 stages, and to be prepared to discuss how the 5 stages aren’t the be all end all of grief, they are not and never were meant to be linear, and that not everyone relates to them."

x45d5l,in14hwc,Orion819,2022-09-04 08:12:23,0,"I've always found photo sharing to be a very helpful early intervention for grief. It often leads to memory/story sharing and helps the client feel you have a better sense of the loss and care enough to want to connect with who their loved one was...and for you to be able to picture the person.

I worked as a grief counselor in hospice for awhile....grief takes a different form often on a week to week basis---regret, longing, anger, wrestling with their own spirituality, wrestling with their own mortality and existential concerns, looking for ways to connect with their lost loved one in their absence........the client just wants you to be with them in it....and that's the most important part---acknowledging how hard it is and that there's nothing either of you can do except journey through everything that comes up together on a week to week basis.

People who are grieving are often bombarded by unhelpful forms of ""support""----platitudes, other peoples spiritual beliefs, other peoples timelines about how long they should be grieving. Be the exception!!!! Be one person in their life who doesn't use platitudes or try to make them feel better....grief sucks and show them that you can handle that.  Give them permission to grieve however they need and sit with them in it. That's what's most important I think."

x45d5l,imu3fiy,Jaiboyben,2022-09-02 19:24:52,2,"Thank you this is very reassuring.  I guess sometimes as a brand new therapist I have this idea that I’m supposed to spontaneously create this therapy magic and “fix” everyone immediately.   And idk certain topics (anxiety, attachment, personal narrative) I feel confident I can actually help.  But.  With grief, it feels sometimes like the only thing that would help is to have the person back and I obviously can’t do that.   

But the idea that many sessions are more about holding space and allowing someone to. It feel alone in their pain, I can do that!    

And yes David Kessler seems fantastic.  I’ve been listening to him talk about his new book on the “sixth stage” of hope and it’s great."

x45d5l,imxnmgq,MediocrePast,2022-09-03 15:11:40,2,"I know of several others that I just can’t think of off the top of my head right now. One of my last classes in grad school last fall was on death, loss, and grief. I’ll edit this comment in a bit when I’m able to either look through some of the notes or at least give the names of the books we used for the class.

EDIT: Okay, so when looking through my notes, the things I find helpful are: Worden’s Mediators of Mourning, the Narrative model, Two-track model (different from dual process), and task model. If you pm me I could send you the notes I have from the class on these things. The books we used were The Last Dance: Encountering Death and Dying (DeSpeldee and Strickland), and Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy: A Handbook for the Mental Health Practitioner (Worden).

I hope that all helps! I have worked in grief settings for several years as a volunteer support group facilitator, but with children. We typically do an activity with them every group, and I’m not sure how they would translate to adults. One that might work well is at some point to make a rememberance box of sorts. It depends on how your client feels about it- they could make it just a box with things related to their child, or they could decorate the outside of the box as well if that feels beneficial. I’ve seen older teens/young-adults do this with success."

I signed up for an internship that charged me $75/ monthly. Needless to say I was pissed. Not only pay my school but also pay the site and work for free. I ended up getting a 2nd internship because my first one (that I was paying for) didn’t have enough clients for every new clinician.

Students are gaslit to believe that that best they can hope for is a stipend “for gas money” (which nowadays won’t even cover gas). Many sites charge clients to see interns, who are not compensated for their services. After I get my license I plan to open my own practice and eventually become a supervisor so that I can compensate my interns in a way that is fair and proportional to their training and the work they put in.

It’s total exploitation and just because this is how things have been done in the past doesn’t mean they should still be done this way now. I don’t get the logic at all! It’s even more gross because not all internships provide supervision as expected so not only are we working for free, we’re often not even getting the support and resources we’re paying for/are entitled to.

ulv0he,i7yz4a5,Injenu,2022-05-09 21:31:04,2,"For my undergrad degree in computing, I had to do an internship, it was 2002 and I think I made $17 an hour. Now there are many jobs where that's what I can expect to earn when I graduate after having done a year of work for negative money (have to pay the university). I'm still committed to this career change, but it makes no sense."
ulv0he,ip79cfs,Specialist_Pea1307,2022-09-20 14:56:10,2,"I've had a graduate assistantship that covers 85% of my education, yet I'm still banking student loan refunds to get me through my internship year."
ulv0he,i80a1xt,piscado777,2022-05-10 03:28:09,-1,"I can understand not enjoying working for free. I did my practicum and internships also, but allow me to give you the perspective of a clinic owner. For a long time, we stopped accepting any interns. There is almost no upside for the clinic. The intern can't bill insurance. People who self pay for services would rather see someone licensed. That's leaves pro Bono and low price sliding scale as potential clients. The interns need an hour of supervision each week (which eliminates a billable hour), and they reserve therapy rooms which ties up a resource. We have never made a dime off of an intern. They always cost us money and time. We have one intern currently and took him on as a favor to a former professor. If he decides to stay with us after graduation, that is the only way we will benefit. If he moves on, we will have ""given back to the field"" once again."
ulv0he,i7zlxt9,BudBurst,2022-05-10 00:22:17,1,"Wait, what? You don’t have a class associated with your internship and practicum? I don’t mind paying for credits because we meet weekly in small groups, and the professor leading it should be compensated for their time. Also, we are allowed to be paid for our time—I just applied for a community services board internship that pays $20-$25 an hour. And my mom made like nothing during her internship for her PsyD, but she still got paid a little. Is that an official policy—that you cannot receive payment?"
ulv0he,i7zmqlm,xburning_embers,2022-05-10 00:28:16,1,"I was working in community mental health (which paid terribly) & was able to count it for my hours.  I code have done it otherwise,  as my husband was also working there and in the same program."
ulv0he,i7zn1wt,webcuter,2022-05-10 00:30:38,1,"I just haggled through a situation where my university gave me a list of people to contact for my Practicum/internship. I contact over 35, I got about half denials, and half never got back to me. ONE accepted me ONE. When I told my university that they had accepted me, their response was that the placement was no longer viable."
ulv0he,i7zqare,HadTo87,2022-05-10 00:55:00,1,Agreed. The only reason I could justify practicum was that they covered my other costs.
ulv0he,i80884w,Dense-Butterfly-4085,2022-05-10 03:12:42,1,"Yes your rant is completely valid! I’m in the same boat as you. I even tried applying as a GA for the school to see if they’d reduce my tuition, but no—they’re just paying me minimum wage 🙃"
ulv0he,i80feya,rubyred138,2022-05-10 04:15:29,1,I got paid during my traineeship but I am in California where it is allowed.

ulv0he,irutcw3,BugInevitable1504,2022-10-11 05:07:34,1,It's even more ridiculous for sites and supervisors to be honest. People here are complaining about being paid nothing who want to enter the field. Sites and supervisors who are well-established in the field who take on expense and risk to open their practices to interns are not paid anything by Universities. That's something to consider here and it isn't.
ulv0he,i7xv441,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 16:58:01,79,"The fact that you have to take breaks in your program to be able to afford it should be eye opening to the people running these programs and CACREP (if you're in the US). It's no wonder there's a shortage of mental health counselors and therapists, it's a bitch to get a degree and get licensed."
ulv0he,i7xubcf,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 16:52:44,94,"I just really don't understand how any of this is legal. And how various counseling associations/organizations just let this happen without advocating for students. This ""pay your dues"" mentality is so predatory and very ironic coming from a mental health profession."
ulv0he,i7xzaym,zephyr1101,2022-05-09 17:25:47,12,This sounds just like mine. Do you happen to go to widener? Lol
ulv0he,i7y52rl,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 18:04:36,41,"110%. Gatekeeping various professions is necessary in some ways as far as skills, ethics, and what not but it shouldn't be done in a way to keep certain economic classes out."
ulv0he,i7yrrbe,aCandaK,2022-05-09 20:39:13,20,"Yes, and this keeps out older people who might be brilliant counselors because they cannot work for free for 1000 hours (in my state internship & practicum are about 1000 hrs total)."
ulv0he,i7zexm7,None,2022-05-09 23:28:56,2,"Except if you can even make it through these conditions, the pay outside of private practice is measely compared to many other masters level positions."
ulv0he,i7xusby,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 16:55:53,9,"Right? Exactly. And I don't know about your program, but mine can't be completed any faster than 4 semesters, even if I'm doing more than the required hours per semester. If I could go part-time with my job or even quit so that I could do my internship ""full-time"" to complete my hours faster I would do that so that I'm not paying thousands of dollars for a year and change."
ulv0he,i809lqb,Awkward-Number-9495,2022-05-10 03:24:16,3,Mine was paid too. I feel really blessed right now.
ulv0he,i7z4csg,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 22:08:46,5,Truly amazing that you're able to do this at all with a 6 year old to care for!
ulv0he,i7z54ca,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 22:14:25,2,"Oh I don't doubt at all that I probably *could* be paid legally, but you're right, why would anyone choose to if they're not required and most clinics don't?

I wish I could've sought out a private practice like the one you're planning to start, but my program won't allow me to intern at a private practice."
ulv0he,ip754la,Specialist_Pea1307,2022-09-20 14:28:04,2,Right. I feel like a lot of us pay for supervision through tuition and we're given like... 5 minutes of the supervisors' time when our caseload might be 10 - 15 people.
ulv0he,i800to4,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 02:13:21,1,"This! I mean that’s a higher salary than I’d expect, I’d settle for half if I’m working part-time but still!"
ulv0he,i7yr5hn,SeaSea89,2022-05-09 20:35:02,14,I wonder if the internship difference between the fields is due to the pink-collar (sp?/right word?) therapy/counseling if not seen as a “female” career it could be seen as a professionalization of the unpaid labor traditionally associated with femininity? Or if it’s just an extension of the exploration of health workers in the for-profit medical complex.
ulv0he,i7ynhul,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 20:09:59,3,"Agreed, and I don’t even know if those professions require internships. Like I know my fiancé who is in finance was not required to do an internship during undergrad but that’s often how you get the best job post-graduation. But this is required, I have to do it in order to graduate. I still think ANY unpaid internship is unacceptable, but ESPECIALLY a required one."
ulv0he,i7zyxa5,thefrenchswerve,2022-05-10 01:59:13,1,YEP.
ulv0he,i800prr,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 02:12:31,1,"I think learning about working with diverse clients is still valuable in the graduate setting but you’re right in that we do and could learn most of this in a bachelors degree, I’ve been saying that for years. If nurses can practice with a bachelors, we should be a hell of a lot closer to being able to practice with a bachelors than we are."
ulv0he,ip768nj,Specialist_Pea1307,2022-09-20 14:35:39,2,"I'm so grateful to my fieldwork advisor for handling all my questions, especially when sites fall through... But the school still doesn't make it easy. I work 45 hours per week, attend 3-4 night classes, have homework, and have to find time to send resumes, make phone calls, do interviews, etc. I'm constantly pouring from one cup into another just to survive."
ulv0he,i7zfls4,None,2022-05-09 23:34:02,1,Sounds just like what I'm going through. 😭
ulv0he,i7zj3wu,living_in_nuance,2022-05-10 00:00:49,8,"My site supervisor spends an hour with us each week. Also time to answer emails and texts of course, but they are overseeing typically 6 interns at a time. She sees two of us at a time (so 3 hours a week plus email and text time). In turn, we each probably have a caseload of 10-15 clients each with pay ranging anywhere from typically $30-85 a session. That’s easily $1800- 5100 a week that practice is bringing in. Yes, they and the practice are making plenty of money for essentially a small amount of time."
ulv0he,i7y4epm,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 18:00:07,4,"I fully support the idea that supervisors working at these agencies should be paid for their time. I don't know how that works when someone is being hired at a clinic to work full-time, but I would definitely want to know before going into my position that I'm going to be responsible for supervising pracitcum students and be paid accordingly. It would be hard to give my all in supervising a student when I'm not being paid for it, simply because I'm sure you don't have the extra time. As much as we'd like to support future generations of counselors/therapists, and I'm sure it brings a certain level of joy to do so, it can be that enjoyable when you're being overworked and underpaid."
ulv0he,i7z6pir,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 22:26:08,1,"Are you a PsyD?

Edit: asking because most clinical psych PhD programs offer funding to my knowledge"
ulv0he,i7xx59l,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 17:11:31,8,my student handbook states that I'm not allowed to be an employee of my practicum or internship site.
ulv0he,i7y7qe2,Parking_Credit66,2022-05-09 18:22:54,12,"counseling is one of the most manipulative and toxic careers in the U.S. unlike doctors, lawyers, etc we do not end up having large salaries that make us feel better about all the work we’ve put in, we simply continue to be underpaid for a job that is so incredibly exhausting and demanding - i hope counselors can begin to stand together and demand more from our country"
ulv0he,i7y08or,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 17:32:04,6,"I for sure wouldn’t expect to be paid anywhere near the same amount for my intern-level service as I would be paid once licensed or once I have my degree, but damn, something would be better than nothing. I work in a clinic on campus as a clinic assistant and even there I’m paid about $10 an hour for the administrative stuff I do. It would at least help offset the cost of tuition."
ulv0he,i7ylo12,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 19:57:28,10,"For sure, any unpaid internship in any field is unacceptable. A stipend to subsidize food and housing should be the bare minimum"
ulv0he,i7z6fd5,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 22:24:01,3,"Thank you for your service! My university provided me with a list of pre-approved places, which was helpful, but I still had to set everything else up. I hope you get somewhere with your department! At the very least, if interns aren't going to be paid by the sites (something I don't think your department has control over) the university shouldn't be charging for those ""credits."""
ulv0he,i7zzx3e,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 02:06:34,1,"I really appreciate this perspective and your clinics desire to pay interns.
I said this in a previous comment but unfortunately my program doesn’t allow me to intern at private practices so even if I found one as lovely as yours, I wouldn’t be able to take it."
ulv0he,ip76wqz,Specialist_Pea1307,2022-09-20 14:40:05,1,Tuition doesn't cover that?
ulv0he,i7ylaf3,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 19:54:54,3,"I definitely could not do this process without my partner who is fronting the majority of our shared bills at this point so that I can pay tuition, so I hear you"
ulv0he,i80eqq6,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 04:09:17,5,"I appreciate the fact that you're trying to offer a different experience, but honestly it's reading very ""I've suffered, so you should suffer too.""  


I never suggested that clinics go bankrupt trying to hire interns. Several other people have mentioned other clinics (some their own) being able to pay interns without it causing them to lose enough money to complain about it, so clearly it's possible. Also, with virtual therapy becoming more popular, and something I will definitely be doing at my site, tying up a room is no longer as much of a concern. I also work at a doctoral training clinic on campus, and while we are sliding scale and do not accept insurance, I can promise you the people coming in don't care at all whether their provider is licensed, and we always have a waitlist. They just want low-cost services.   


My main issue was the fact that I am paying the university to work at a clinic site. I would be more than happy to pay my supervisor for their lost billable hour. But I will stand by the fact that unpaid work of any kind is unacceptable. Whether that's changed through government subsidization or some other means, I don't know, but our current system is far too predatory."
ulv0he,i800cks,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 02:09:46,3,"Also, I’m not going to pretend that my tuition goes right to my professor."
ulv0he,i7zyc3k,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 01:54:50,1,"Correct, I cannot be an employee of the clinic where I am getting hours.

We do have a seminar class associated with internship but it is 1 credit, and therefore less time per week than our other classes. The internship experience is 2 credits. I haven’t actually been billed for it all yet because I start in the fall, but this is my understanding of it."
ulv0he,i8007u0,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 02:08:47,2,"That makes sense, something is better than nothing. I’m very fortunate in that I have a fiancé who is covering most of our other expenses otherwise I definitely could not do this at all without taking out many loans."
ulv0he,i800294,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 02:07:37,1,Wow that’s unbelievable. I’m so sorry.
ulv0he,i80al52,dream_cycle,2022-05-10 03:32:44,1,"Ugh that sucks! Mine will only pay for 2 credits per semester ""plus compensation"" whatever that means. Wasn't worth me giving up my full-time work from home job for that."
ulv0he,irvnvuq,dream_cycle,2022-10-11 11:58:39,1,Also this article is referencing supervision after graduation which was not the point of my post. I would be paid at that point and would also have no problem paying a supervisor for their work if I need to. I wouldn’t expect a private practice supervisor to supervise for free.
ulv0he,irvl94q,dream_cycle,2022-10-11 11:31:28,1,"I wouldn’t say it’s even more ridiculous, and I think it greatly depends on the site. We are free labor for sites, allowing them to see more clients. Where is the expense? Especially with an increase in telehealth, many of us don’t need dedicated offices everyday. Sure there’s some risk but we have to carry our own liability insurance. Also supervisors are generally paid more from what I can tell, so they are being paid for their work just not by the university. A lot of sites rely on having interns and are begging for them so I don’t think it’s as one sided as you’re making it sound. Also I did say I’d rather pay my site directly for their part in my internship, so I did “consider it.” I would much rather them take my money in this particular instance than the university."
ulv0he,i7xujs8,moodymadam,2022-05-09 16:54:17,38,I am right in that boat with you right now. I am doing classes and practicum next semester. I also have to work full time. How does a field about mental health justify treating students this way?
ulv0he,i80gttr,Magical_Narwhal_1213,2022-05-10 04:28:40,14,"And ironic for a field that espouses social justice without realize the amount of burden this places on folx and how many extra barriers this creates for people with historically oppressed identities!! There are great people out there. I own my own agency and we pay our interns well- have a socialist model so all money that is earned is split amongst everyone so me, with my PhD and my interns/all staff make the same per hour…and we all make a lot actually! It’s great! This exploitive bullshit is so rooted in capitalism and white supremacy and needs to end."
ulv0he,i7xzenl,kenny2ea,2022-05-09 17:26:28,5,Why yes I do!
ulv0he,i80bpi8,Middle-Obligation134,2022-05-10 03:42:19,2,While I am so so grateful it’s also sad we are this grateful about getting paid for our work. We yield great patient outcomes and my supervisor is able to bill insurance with me so if he didn’t pay I would now think that’s super greedy and exploitive. I remember interviewing at a bigger firm and they work through a hospital so for sure they bill Al the potential patients I would be seeing but they will only pay after I meet the internship 15 hrs a week requirements… and that was not a guarantee :0

ulv0he,ip74rsw,Specialist_Pea1307,2022-09-20 14:25:40,1,Same. My program won't allow internship at a private practice. Not sure why - I'd probably get more learning out of it rather than being given 4 minutes in group supervision at a community mill.
ulv0he,ip7ij3h,dream_cycle,2022-09-20 15:55:31,1,"We HAVE to get an hour of supervision per week, and surprisingly I haven’t had any difficulty doing that at my community site (though even with a caseload of only 3 clients right now, I could use 2 hours)"
ulv0he,i7z488s,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 22:07:51,2,Never really thought about the first question but I think it's an interesting one. Both are plausible for sure.

I've been offered an internship for $18.75 per client hour and was told it was the best I was going to get. When I did the math, it ended up being like $700 for the whole semester. Some engineering interns make $50,000. It's unreal."
ulv0he,i804l54,cangodhearme,2022-05-10 02:42:55,2,"Yes, definitely! Reading back, I can see what I said was a little unclear lol I meant that we learn many things in grad school that we've already learned in our prior education, when some of the most important trainings and lessons that are taught in continuing education and post-grad programs that could have easily been taught in grad school. And seriously that's so true, we should definitely be way closer to practicing after our bachelors!"
ulv0he,i7zogc2,XXreindeer,2022-05-10 00:41:05,1,"If you subtract an hourly fee, let's say $100/hour for the supervisor and then subtract another good 40% or more for the business expenses and taxes and office supplies, paying the support staff, paying the cleaning staff, etc. they are not making as much as you think. They don't get to keep the whole session fee you are bringing in. Add in the time spent when you need help and the time spent reviewing all of your paperwork knowing it is their license on the line, they are not making money off of you. It's a service to supervise, not a money maker. Even at that high amount they are making less than their session fee per hour supervising you. In conclusion, yes, I think you should get paid for your internship but it is your school making money off of you, not your internship site."

ulv0he,i7y51gl,None,2022-05-09 18:04:21,1,it is considered employment? Could argue that the practice is illegal and that you should get paid minimum wage.

ulv0he,irwbgzw,BugInevitable1504,2022-10-11 15:05:13,1,"I wrote my last reply hastily while tired ... so I apologize for not being as thoughtful as I could have been (a lesson in lapsing on mindfulness!) ... when I ran into your post doing some research on whether or not continuing to bring on interns is even feasible for a small business/private practice (after working late yet again) and I was a bit shocked. You are totally right and make a great point: it depends on the site and sites vary greatly in terms of business model/structure/infrastructure. I guess I wanted to raise awareness on the side of sites and to temper the bold assumptions made by those just entering the field with limited experience that to me came off as ignorant/arrogant/entitled...Sites are solely dependent on one source of revenue to support business operations and that is clients' fees. This has to cover /everything/ and I don't think you realize just what this entails. Every hour and dollar spent training, supporting staff, emailing, onboarding their clients, getting them support staff like an insurance biller, reviewing their documentation, supervising them, marketing, every expense, software, and office infrastructure, depends only on clients' fees (which are low to begin with because people will not pay an intern what a licensed clinician charges). A new office rug is $100. A credit card machine was $400. Most supervisors with 10-15 years of experience in my area charge a clinical hourly rate between $100-200/hr, so spending time making $0 hour could otherwise be spent directly seeing clients. Also, new clinicians require a ton of support and training, and it often takes a lot of time for many of them to develop adequate clinical skills, so sites also run the risk of their reputation and disappointed clients. Also every crisis we've managed which has required work on weekends, have been high stress, has involved an underskilled intern. I guess the list goes on and on, and many of my colleagues are likewise reconsidering if this is even feasible to do on sites' end. If Universities compensated sites, we would have more resources to make it work, but they don't. If you feel there is scant support at sites it's probably because  senior clinicians must limit their unpaid hours."

How can we do that when there is no other option?? Or so few that's it too competitive to help the majority of us?"

While my supervisor puts in some extra time it is nowhere near what you are stating nor are the expenses you’re accounting for that high as well as this practice doesn’t even accrue some that you listed. Never said the supervisor or owner take 100% but we pour money into support of the practice for a very low number of hours a week in support.

The only explanation I can think of it maybe so that, in theory, we have more leverage to say that we’re only going to do the things required by our program instead of taking up too much time doing other duties assigned that aren’t really related to the internship experience? I really don’t know."
ulv0he,i7y5fq5,dream_cycle,2022-05-09 18:07:04,3,No because I'm not allowed to be employed by the site where I'm doing my practicum/internship according to my handbook.
ulv0he,ip7i7gk,dream_cycle,2022-09-20 15:53:27,1,I wish!
ulv0he,i7y9lks,moodymadam,2022-05-09 18:35:37,25,"
In my area, so few places are taking practicum and intern students. They are so low staffed they don't have the extra people to supervise us. As a result, they only want licensed therapists and, if they want interns, they want doctoral interns. So many of my classmates struggle to find sites and can't meet requirements before graduation. So when they find a site, they don't even want to advocate for themselves to be paid because they could barely find a site in the first place.

And even if we were in a better position to advocate for ourselves, this unpaid internship expectation is so deeply rooted that advocating is just going to get us passed over. Why accept someone who demands to be paid when they can find someone who won't?

Edit: not saying we shouldn't advocate for change. We should. But it feels a bit hopeless right now."
ulv0he,i7ycg8j,tangoprjct,2022-05-09 18:54:57,13,"I had this exact experience in my MFT program. They can't get us enough clients so they recommend we ""order business cards"" to advertise. We also get told, whenever we complain, that we are dysregulated and ""need to work on ourselves."" I'm sorry you are going through that."
ulv0he,i8151fs,XXreindeer,2022-05-10 09:39:37,1,That sounds like a bad placement in many ways. I'm sorry you are working for free without good support. It's hard to learn and grow in a situation like that.

My first year, I had two simultaneous clinical practica and a graduate research assistantship. I didn’t get paid for the clinical work. 

Psychology PhD funding is notoriously ass, with many of us in funded programs still graduating with a pretty hefty debt burden."
ulv0he,i80p3r8,thefrenchswerve,2022-05-10 05:56:37,1,Now I’m on a mission to find out why!
ulv0he,i7y9b7p,None,2022-05-09 18:33:41,1,"hmmm would have to literally go to the college or the state/federal licensing board or some sort of employment/jobs regulatory agency and change the law to require they pay and argue that the practicum is considering providing a service.

they could use the counter-argument that you are getting the service of interacting with clients and having access to a reliable source of clients to utilize for your training and would have to say YES but I am providing xyz service...

money and payment is something that humans made up....

is the service more beneficial to you (for learning and experience) or to the client (for getting your service). but does it even matter who is benefitting more?

for one.. could argue that you shouldn't be paying to work and that that should at least be considered free which is better than paying..

...

this is kinda like when college actors perform in a play and are paying to attend the college, which is a requirement for being in the play, but yet the college charges money for people in the audience to come attend the play but the actors do not get paid

or how college athletes are playing their sport and colleges require admission fees to watch the game but the athletes do not get paid (but some may get scholarships)

or how students may be doing research for a college and it may or may not get paid but yet the university may get the money/credit for it and the student does not get any money

so this is a similar issue across other disciplines too

the whole thing of companies having ""volunteers"" and some people get paid and others do not - also very fishy

or how one even assigns monetary value to anything and how it is kinda flimsy on how stuff is priced (maybe, maybe not)

EDIT: Can flip the idea around - what are the benefits of not paying students who are in the internship but rather having the students pay? why is this a good thing? (or are there zero good things about this and if so... why does it still exist)"

I bring this up because I have worked with students for more than a decade and a lot of unnecessary drama and negativity occurs at placements when other students complain to other students.

That negativity is contagious and often unfounded.

The same theme will exist anywhere you work if you become a social worker too.

Please take this as a beginner lesson fo focus on YOURSELF and advocate directly for your learning needs with your supervisor. 

If someone is unloading on your unnecessarily, you can also redirect them to the appropriate person to address THEIR learning needs.

It also sounds like you are being given bits and pieces of the story.

It is always appropriate to rule out medical stuff first with any client whether or not they have a MH history.

I remember my second shift I told my preceptor I wanted to not be intimidated by IV starts. I’ll be damned if she didn’t chuckle…I probably attempted 30-50 IVs that shift just bam bam bam. Super comfortable towards the end and pretty decent by the time i finished the semester. 

You’re gonna learn to think on your feet and be resourceful. You’re going to see a lot of shit your classmates won’t and it’ll prepare you so well, if you approach it correctly with a hunger to learn each shift, that you’ll feel somewhat like a real nurse by the end of the semester."

yo7z7g,ivd6l7t,lumenilis,2022-11-07 02:22:21,3,"I went to and graduated from Practicum earlier this year!  I'm working now as a full time Software Engineer (though I'm working for the same company I worked for before making the career transition).  

First, some potential negatives:

* The biggest negative about Practicum is that unlike most other bootcamps, almost all of your learning will be done on your own.  At most bootcamps, my understanding is they'll usually hold classes each day to go over the material and you'll be able to ask questions during that time.  Practicum is different: it's essentially a part-time program where you can work through the material at your own pace.  There aren't daily lectures.  Instead, you work through short lessons on their platform that typically include some theory and then a small coding challenge.  Each cohort does have a tutor who is a professional developer and they will usually do a couple of optional lessons each sprint, but if you want a more traditional classroom environment, this isn't it.
* Another negative is the platform itself.  It generally works fine, but for some coding challenges, if you don't solve it one very specific way, you can get stuck.  This happened all the time to people in my cohort.  Usually, if a challenge is like that, someone will have asked about it in Slack before and you can usually find the message and use it to help guide you through it.  
* Because the program is largely self-driven and done on your own time, it can be kind of lonely compared to other bootcamps.  This is really dependent on your schedule and your cohort, but because there isn't a set daily schedule, it's harder to build connections with your classmates.
* If you're a complete beginner (i.e. you've never coded and intend on starting Practicum in the next week), it will probably take you longer to get through the program than you think especially if you're only putting in the \~20 hours per week that program requires.  I saw a lot of people that had to move to the next cohort back because they missed project deadlines.
* Even though you can do the work at your own pace, you do have to follow your cohort's schedule.  Even if you finished everything early, you have to wait before you can access the next chapter.

Those are all of the potential negatives, but there's also a lot I liked about the program.  

* It's ideal for anyone that is working a full time job IMO.  Not having daily classes or meetings you have to make means anyone with a weird schedule that may not work at a more traditional 8 to 5 bootcamp program can do Practicum without any problems.
* Generally speaking, it's pretty good value for your money, especially if you're someone that does well learning from text.  Almost all of the material is text-based which makes reading through it and taking notes faster (at least for me.). You'll learn the same things that you would learn at a bootcamp that costs significantly more.
* Projects are great and probably the highlight of the program for me.  You'll work on four or five projects during your time at Practicum.  Those projects are all designed by Practicum.  They'll provide you with designs, a list of requirements, coding guidelines, and some general steps to take.  The nice thing about this is the sites look like they're professionally designed, which is great especially if you're not a designer.
* Code reviews are also a highlight.  They're very similar to the ones I get professionally: they'll give you feedback, both positive and negative, as well as recommending optional improvements.  The reviews are very professional and really got me comfortable with the idea of doing code reviews.
* Practicum's team is really open to feedback.  They made several adjustments to the program while I was there based on student feedback which impressed me.
* They have extra things you can do on top of the required material and projects.  For example, they sometimes do hackathons and code jams which can be fun if you have the time to do it.

I think in summary, I can say I would generally recommend the program, especially if you're someone that's looking for something part time and have learned some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on your own.  There are some downsides, but that's going to be true of any boot camp you choose."

wmrivj,ik1bio8,Haroldcares,2022-08-12 19:38:17,9,"You need to start calling schools. You need to contact a school principal and ask if you can fulfill you student teaching obligations there.

First, phone call the school and ask to speak to the principal. When you are asked what the purpose of your call is, say ""student teaching placement."" Ask the for the principal's email too.

Send the principal an email with and state that you are hoping for student teaching placement. State 1) what program you are with, 2) what subject and grade level you are pursuing, 3) that dates, or time frame, you need to be on their campus, and 4) a very simple bullet-point of what you need to accomplish at the school. For example, class observation hours needed, joining lesson prep sessions, interviewing a student, interviewing a parent, sitting on an IEP committee, etc.

Attach to the email, your CV and copies of any other documents a school may require from an adult, such as up-to-date first aid/CPR card, a required child safety course completion certificate from that school's district, a copy of a negative tuberculosis report. If you are missing something specific to the school, an interested principal will guide you to what you need.

In your email, also include your student teaching program director's name and contact information. If this is a possible placement, the school and Mooreland will need to sign a few documents with each other. 

No matter your needs, expect that you will also need to do things for the principal and school. You may start substituting classes immediately. You will do hallway and bus duties. You will get thrown into school life.

The principal, if interested, will reach out to one of their staff members who they think will make a decent mentor. If that staff member agrees - - the principal will respond with a 'yes.'

School placement isn't easy. You'll have to contact many schools. Cast your net wide. Private schools, government schools, charter schools, high needs schools, schools near you, schools far away.

Many successful student teachers are offered their first teaching job at the school they student teach at. 

Good luck!"
wmrivj,ik29ctg,zLightspeed,2022-08-12 23:32:22,3,"Moreland can offer support in finding a placement if necessary, although I'm not sure what that looks like. They can also provide you with a ""virtual mentor"". One thing to consider is that it's perfectly acceptable for your practicum to consist of online teaching. You might be able to find a school (perhaps in Asia?) that will let you teach online remotely for a semester. Even a training school of some kind could be enough. I am sure you could get certified for ESL/English through something like that. Depending on your goals you could then add endorsements to let you teach more subjects, or perhaps go for English QTS which isn't subject specific and never needs to be renewed - very useful for international work. Moreland are super flexible and also very responsive and useful. Strongly recommend sending them a detailed email and you'll get a helpful response. Best of luck"
wmrivj,ik1tkwe,QuarantinePoutine,2022-08-12 21:38:57,3,"I think you’re going to have a very hard time doing this in vancouver. I’m currently in a teaching program in BC and most of the school districts have specific partnerships with the universities that offer teaching programs. At least the one that I am at, the incentive for teachers to take on placement students usually means that they get some kind of credits to take university courses for free (usually for a masters program). It’s also a good way for principals to meet new teachers who they could potentially hire for contracts or have in the school as regular substitutes. 

I hate to say it but I think you will have an extremely difficult time finding a school that will take you on for this. Possibly a private school and might be easier in small town BC. If you’re not affiliated with a local university and won’t be certified to teach in BC after you don’t really have anything to offer them. Just my two cents."

I emailed some schools with my resume and a letter of introduction which Moreland gave me. Some schools never got back to me and one said they couldn’t accept student teachers due to COVID. Luckily, one said they were willing to let me do the clinical there. I think it helped that I had previous experience working at another international school. Moreland is pretty flexible about where you do the clinical; it doesn’t necessarily have to be a K-12 school (can be a language academy, etc.) and it can be online. If you don’t have a qualified mentor at the school, you can request a virtual mentor who is a Moreland instructor. If you’re having difficulty finding a placement, they will help you."
wmrivj,ik10hfy,Azelixi,2022-08-12 18:26:32,1,"You need to find a school to record your classes on what you're trying to get certified in. Whether it's online or offline, whether  it's a school you're currently teaching at or you need to get to finding one that will let you do this classes."
wmrivj,ik1e7o1,EclecticMedal,2022-08-12 19:55:53,1,"Wow, thank you so much for this detailed response. Very appreciated - one question, do you think it would be easier to do this in Canada or overseas??"
wmrivj,ik33ira,Crazy_Homer_Simpson,2022-08-13 03:28:56,2,">Even a training school of some kind could be enough. I am sure you could get certified for ESL/English through something like that

This isn't quite the case actually. I've known of a couple people who did Moreland while working for a language center (same thing as a training school, just what they're called here) in Vietnam and they were not able to do the practicum in their language center classes. The center they worked at had contracts with local public schools they'd send teachers to and they had to do their practicum teaching those classes.

That definitely could be an option for OP though. It's not hard to get a job at a company that sends teachers to local public schools and they could then get licensed in ESL"
wmrivj,ik2axw6,EclecticMedal,2022-08-12 23:44:08,1,"Awesome, this is great know.  Thanks for the info."
wmrivj,ik1u15j,EclecticMedal,2022-08-12 21:42:07,2,"Yeah that makes sense.  I would guess that most Moreland graduates have done their practicums overseas.  I just wonder how they managed to arrange that - were they working or volunteering at the school without a license, did they just contact the school to come in for those 3 months? Hopefully someone on here who did it can help."
wmrivj,in1pmty,iknowicandobetter,2022-09-04 12:38:07,1,Actually you can do your placement at a language school. BC has loads of them.
wmrivj,ik99iux,tomatoesinmygarden,2022-08-14 14:32:05,2,"I'd try Blaine or Point Roberts too. Since you are not getting paid, it shouldn't be a visa/taxes problem. But if language schools qualify, I'd try some of the immigrant settlement programs. Have you tried the local private Chinese or Indian schools?"

wmrivj,ik1o2yj,Haroldcares,2022-08-12 21:01:00,2,"The licensing process is would be far easier in Canada.

If done overseas, you would be obligated to a teaching contract. Actively teaching AND being a student will demand lots of your time and will be very successful. This is the case for veteran teachers who decide to further their education while they work.

As a new teacher, you will be frustrated and lost, constantly (which is the case with every first year) . Your overseas employer won't care about your educational needs - you have a job to do. Overseas teaching staff will be far less willing to help for a variety of reasons. It's not impossible to do, but making the social connections you need to make student teaching a success is just harder overseas for lots and lots of reasons. You will be occupied with visa issues, you need to set up banking, nothing in your new country will be in your native language which makes everything for you harder.

Get licensed in Canada first. I also suggest teach anywhere in Canada for at least two years. Then, when you go International, you can get a decent job.

There are many many shitty schools on the international scene. And with no experience, even with a license, those shitty schools will be the only ones who will hire you. It's a terrible experience.

You owe it to yourself to do at least 2 years in a Canadian school just so you can understand how a school can function reasonably well, including staff meetings, lesson planning,  parental relations, and classroom management."
wmrivj,ik37h7g,zLightspeed,2022-08-13 04:05:01,2,"Interesting, I've got one person in my cohort who are at a training school but it's for arts/drama. Maybe they're doing something similar."
wmrivj,ikgxdol,EclecticMedal,2022-08-16 02:39:39,1,That sounds like a great idea.  So basically they were teaching ESL in Vietnam and did their practicum in the same city they were based in? Would you mind sharing what center they work at?
wmrivj,ik1xsij,QuarantinePoutine,2022-08-12 22:08:33,2,I have a couple of friends who did theirs in Asia while doing a TEFL placement. Seems to be much easier. I’m sure Moreland can even offer some suggestions to you.

wmrivj,ik1rr3r,EclecticMedal,2022-08-12 21:26:24,2,"Appreciate the info (again).  Just a few tidbits for clarification - I taught primary in Thailand (non international school, just a regular Thai private elementary) and taught kids in Korea as well so have a rudimentary understanding of teaching.  I'm not intending to do get my Canadian teaching license or spend a further 2 more years here after - I'm intending to do the Teach Now / Moreland University program which is 6 months online learning and then 3 months where you are assessed via a practicum.  So that's what my question was specifically referring to (it was somewhat unclear).  The home country license + 2 years route is clearly the best and ideal but it's just not for me at this point in my life and there do seem to be successful International teachers who went through Moreland - would def like to know how / where they did their practicum."
wmrivj,ik38oyt,Crazy_Homer_Simpson,2022-08-13 04:16:45,1,"Yeah I'm not exactly sure what the reason is they weren't able to do the practicum in their classes at the language center, but I know people who did iPGCEs while working at the same company and it was the same for them–they had to do the clinical portion at a public school. I think it was either because the language center classes were 2 hours long and not normal class periods or because they were mixed age groups rather than a single grade. I can't think of any other differences that could be the reason."
wmrivj,il7ild3,Crazy_Homer_Simpson,2022-08-21 16:22:47,2,"Yes, that's exactly what they were doing. They were working at ILA, but really I think any job that places you in local public schools will work, as long as it's not one where you are following scripted lessons because you do need to be planning them yourself. It's honestly very easy to get a job that allows you to teach in public schools so that could be an option worth considering. 

If you were to do it in Vietnamese public schools, you would have to use the virtual mentor option that Moreland offers though, unless I'm mistaken. The mentor has to be a licensed teacher and none of those work at language centers. There's not necessarily anything wrong with the virtual mentor, but do consider if you think it'd be more beneficial to do with a mentor who is working at the school.

If you have some TEFL experience already, there are jobs at ""bilingual international"" schools where you could do it as well.

Also, if what you're teaching is ESL for the practicum, then that's what your license will have to be in initially, though you can get other endorsements if you take the PRAXIS exams for those from what I understand"
wmrivj,ik1zq1p,EclecticMedal,2022-08-12 22:22:18,2,"Cheers, I've signed up for an info session so hopefully they explain some sort of path or process.  Good luck with your BC teacher license."

wmrivj,ik2xm41,HiddenXS,2022-08-13 02:38:36,2,"I'm not really sure Moreland would get you a provincial teaching licence anyway.

I don't know BC at all, but if it's anything like Ont you might have some difficulty finding a local public school that will let you do your practicum there. I know there's been a shortage of mentor teachers for teachers college students here,  and I just can't see a principal inviting in a student from an online program they've never heard of to work with a teacher who unfamiliar with what sort of pedagogy you've been learning. Principals tend to cover their butts with anything that might go sideways, I had one very hesitant to sign a document for me that stated I taught at her school for six months even though it was for the Ontario College of Teachers,  she'd just never seen one of those documents before. If you need to record your lessons,  that could freak a principal out. You'd need permission from every single parent of the students in the classroom... 


Not saying it's impossible,  I don't know BC. But you may need to look far and wide,  and I'd recommend knowing at the precise details of what your Moreland program requires of your placement."

1. Employment means that you're an employee, not a volunteer or independent contractor. In almost all cases, this means that you must be paid at least minimum wage and you get a W-2 statement (not a 1099 or other form) at tax time.

2. Full-time means that you must work at least 30 hours per week *and* meet your employer's definition, which might be more. (Or you must work part-time for multiple eligible employers). [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSLF/comments/s07a6f/any_nurses_full_time_is_different_in_a_hospital/hs04vib/).

3. The eligible employer must meet [the program's definition](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualifying-employer). For-profit employers are not eligible for PSLF, no matter what kind of work they do. And you must be an employee of the eligible employer itself, not an employee of a different company (e.g. contractor or staffing agency) that does work on behalf of the eligible agency/organization.

If you think your work counts, then use [the Help Tool](https://studentaid.gov/pslf/#!/pslf/launch) to generate your PSLF Form, submit it to the employer(s) for signature, you sign, and then submit to MOHELA for processing."

v3okj1,ib0kzvm,morncuppacoffee,2022-06-03 08:45:29,8,"This is the unfortunate side of field placements.

IME there will never be enough to go around and as such students basically have to suck it up and take what they can get.

You do have options to switch out but they are generally not very good ones.

I also suspect it’s gotten worse since Covid where there’s even less incentive to take on a student when most places right now are struggling with their own staffing issues.

OP at this point I would just power thru and finish your hours.  At the end of the day what matters is just getting your degree and not having to interact with this person any longer.

I also know it sounds frustrating to hear, but you can learn a lot from a bad placement especially in terms of what you aren’t willing to put up with at a job.

I have found through the years that the relationship with management and my colleagues will make or break a job.

I also have gotten better at dealing with certain “personalities” who will exist in every job we have unfortunately. This is just the nature of working with other humans."

When a student postures to learn, they do not pay to be beaten down. There is no true advocacy from the schools and no one stands up for the students.

You must record what is going on and make human resources aware. If the school is aware ensure you are following the processes.

KNOW they do not determine your self-worth, this means to say the school, the site, or any other human being.
You are worthy to be what you want to serve others, you are invaluable and priceless.

No I'm not, but if social work is ONLY sweeping, then why did I go to school for three years?

 lol yeah went off on my own stuff here, but in short, you're not flawed, Practicum is flawed - it sets up agencies to think because they aren't paying you that you are their slave, and that you have nothing to offer. They don't price you in, so they don't give you anything to actually do. At worst they consider you a useless object. Just get through it and try to forget the whole miserable experience."

The dean of the school of social work got involved and tried to have me quit or get expelled out of the program. I threatened to sue the school if she did. I laid into her about how this was supposed to be a compassionate field but here she was giving me a hard time about 3 missed classes. I knew that two was the limit. But my life partner was ill. I even had doctor’s notes stating she needed to be monitored. 

To be fair, my partner became totally incapacitated when she had seizures. My job was to make sure she didn’t swallow her tongue and to monitor her closely. I couldn’t do that from school.

After I threatened to sue the school if she expelled me, she let it go, but she gave me literally the worst internship placement. I had to bite the bullet to get through. 

I learned that the world doesn’t give a f*%k about you. Sometimes you just gotta get through it to get to the other side. This field is full of it’s own toxic messes - like a LOT of toxic messes. 

I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this. It truly sucks. You could try to call her out but you’re right there might be consequences, unfortunately.  I’d talk to your supervisor before I’d talk directly with the lady you work with. If you do call her out, make sure you use legal/HR language like: she’s creating a toxic work environment, she’s singling you out of others, unprofessional behavior/language, etc  - all these words are legal / hr jargon that they would be required to respond to if you say something."

She talked bad about social work. One time she referred to one of our client's children as a ""thug"". She was a major workaholic, steam roller and perfectionist. Nothing I did satisfied her. When some MSW's joined us second semester they also saw how terrible it was. They were from a different college and their liaison got them out of there after a very bad incident where the supervisor got the employees to turn on us and sit us all down for a talk where they told us we should be grateful to be there. Me and my peer talked with our liaison and the liaisons boss about it and had this meeting with the supervisor. It helped a little bit. But still a very bad experience. They didn't use the placement in the future, at least while she was there. I wish we would have pushed earlier on in the year to go ahead and try to switch placements before we were too far into the year. Not sure if it would have made a difference but I almost quit social work after that experience. Luckily my MSW practicum was amazing. And my BSW one helped me learn how to deal with steamroller type people who typically would really intimidate me. Later on after we left, she ended up turning on the staff and was aggressive towards them then had an affair with one of the clients who was in the shelter. The board asked her to resign.

v3okj1,ib2yz9c,hopeful987654321,2022-06-03 21:19:01,1,"I had a BSW supervise me for my MSW practicum. Not ideal but that's all they had. It was hard building a research project with someone who never did one. I ended up learning more on the research from the people who had Masters in psychoeducation who worked at the same place, simply because they did a similar research project for their degree."
v3okj1,ib0s5lm,wholesomedust,2022-06-03 10:32:21,4,That’s how it is. My field professor (who has an MSW) is technically my field supervisor but for sake of simplicity I called the LPC my supervisor.
v3okj1,ib06vjn,pocketsofh,2022-06-03 05:27:06,16,"I'm going to call it shady. Listen up- social workers HAVE to be supervised by other social workers during their practicum for BSW AND MSW in one way or another. There are no ifs, ands or buts about it. YOU are being played and needs to go to the dean ASAP. Then you need to report this to the CSWE. I couldn't imagine being supervised by an LPC. (I've personally never met a competent one and in my state they are incredibly limited and generally not respected as well as social workers or MFTs.) I don't mean to sound harsh but a VERY big part of our profession is to advocate. Nows your chance! You can do this! Think of this as a life experience to take with you on your social work journey."
v3okj1,ib24ucl,RuthlessKittyKat,2022-06-03 17:20:30,1,CWSE is trash.
v3okj1,ib0rqfj,LadyDouchebag,2022-06-03 10:26:36,23,"Again, an LPC can be a field supervisor, which supervises the student's day-to-day work, but the field instructor must be an MSW to address the educational and ethical issues.  If that's the case in OP's field agency, there is nothing to report to CSWE here."
v3okj1,ib14zyf,Therapyuser,2022-06-03 12:53:11,6,Never met a competent LPC? What state are you in?
v3okj1,ib0bdp6,s4misweethe4rt,2022-06-03 06:23:17,5,"Agreed, if the LPC is the only field supervisor and signing off on the practicum hours. I’m surprised that her instructor approved this internship tbh. They should have asked for a resume and checked credentials."
v3okj1,ib0ryp7,coinreed,2022-06-03 10:29:44,10,"I have no idea why you're coming off as so passionate about this problem. I am like OP and have had LPC's supervising me for both my bachelor level social work degree and my masters and honestly believe I came out better for it as the few instances I did work with licensed social workers I had experiences like OP, abusive supervisors. I guess it's a person to person experience because in my state LCSW's are frequently toxic. I'm very much sure that the school is aware that the LPC is in that facility and is granting her school credit appropriately, because the reality of it is it has to do with the work that she's doing not necessarily the person looking over her shoulder about it. There's no reason to stir the pot because of a licensing issue rather focus on what's actually happening with the supervisor at hand."
v3okj1,ib14em6,Anna-Bee-1984,2022-06-03 12:47:51,4,"I was not supervised by a social worker in my second practicum at the MSW level. While it is legal I never received adequate supervision (she didn’t tell me about problems until they were put in a reference letter) and only went to the field supervisor who also didn’t want to hear my opinion on things. While I did a lot of work and learned a bunch, it was not all that positive of an experience. This was after my first practicum told me to leave after I told them I felt uncomfortable and unprepared to do the type of evaluation I had initially said I was going to do. My school made me drop my eval course and reenroll the following semester (didn’t refund me the money either) under the excuse that since I was not in practicum I could not take the course (there were people in the course not currently in practicum and working with agencies they had previously completed a practicum with). By this time I was too tired and too deep into my own mental health issues to fight it. 

This was a internationally regarded and highly highly ranked program"
v3okj1,ib0rx83,wholesomedust,2022-06-03 10:29:11,7,My professor is an MSW and she oversees everything/is also my field instructor.
v3okj1,ib1k6xm,XOXO-Gossip-Crab,2022-06-03 14:53:30,5,I’m shocked to hear this too. Where I’m from LPC are just as competent as social workers - very similar licensing and education requirements. Actually social work is the more lax of the two here
v3okj1,ib25wcy,pocketsofh,2022-06-03 17:28:16,1,California. Here you have to be a Licensed Practical Clinical Counselor (LPCC). So when out of staters with an LPC move in they have to jump through more hoops for licensure. We are one of six states that require this. An LPC cannot treat or diagnose in the state of California without it.
v3okj1,ib276s4,pocketsofh,2022-06-03 17:37:54,1,"Yep, I suppose it is a person to person issue. Like I have never had a poor experience with LCSWs. I'm not sure why an LPC would be able to compliment BSW/MSW curriculum though which is the whole point. OP is paying for school and they may as well get their moneys worth if social work is the way they want to go."
v3okj1,ib0sb6u,LadyDouchebag,2022-06-03 10:34:26,9,"Then your agency appears to be in compliance with the Council on Social Work Education requirements for supervision. I do suggest you speak with your field instructor, the MSW, about the concerns about your LPC field supervisor.  The fact that they're an LPC isn't the issue here as I see it - it's their behavior towards you as a student and its impact on your learning.  I'm so sorry you're dealing with this - I had a similiar situation in my first MSW placement with an LPC field supervisor and a LCSW field instructor who hated each other. I was always getting caught in the middle of their BS."
v3okj1,ib1qx3j,Therapyuser,2022-06-03 15:42:04,3,"I agree, I’m in jersey. Literally have never heard anyone say that in regards to LPC’s. the only difference sometimes is the hours needed from provisional to terminal license"
v3okj1,ib2b3ak,Therapyuser,2022-06-03 18:07:25,3,Regardless you shouldn’t be making broad statements regarding an entire profession. I’ve met both social workers and LPC’s that are competent and not competent
v3okj1,ib28fg7,coinreed,2022-06-03 17:47:10,4,"BSW/MSW curriculum is highly clinical unless you specifically seek out a macro program, and the venn diagram of what an LPC and an LCSW do in counseling is basically a circle. I really don't remember learning anything in my BSW/MSW program that wasn't touched upon by an LPC because even the things that make us different (like ethical standards for example) are the same thing for LPCs, just worded differently. ""Meeting the person where they're at"" = motivational interviewing, P.I.E = systems therapy--who cares what we're calling it, micro social work/counseling -- it all boils down to the same activities. I learned early that sometimes the people with no licenses at all are the best to learn from, and the best supervision I've ever had as a social worker has come from an LPC, because the goals are the same in micro work.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that at a micro level there is really no difference. As long as the school isn't screwing OP over, who cares. OP will be great doing micro work if that's what they're passionate about."
v3okj1,ib2divb,pocketsofh,2022-06-03 18:26:11,-1,"Saying my personal experience isn't a broad statement, but I take your sentiment."
v3okj1,ib29uw0,pocketsofh,2022-06-03 17:57:57,1,"Great information! Again, it doesn't seem like any of this is being translated into OPs experience. I feel like we may be talking about different things. LPCs in my state (CA) aren't the same as LPCC. I'm so glad that you have a great experience with an LPC though."
v3okj1,ib2a0zc,coinreed,2022-06-03 17:59:15,3,You're the one that's focused on licensure versus what's actually happening. LPC or not the supervisor is toxic. No need to advise that the Op isn't getting their money's work in a program cause they aren't working with an LCSW--it's because their supervisor sucks.

> but I'm wondering if they'll have to submit feedback/write-ups to GaTech during the semester and/or at the end. If so, is it short, lengthy, formal, informal?

Yes they will, it's stated in the syllabus in www.omsa.ga, and yes, even though some of the scoring is quantitative, it could also be written as a prose if the employer so wishes.

It's definitely formal, it's part of your grading process."
svl887,hxkkg47,omsa-reddit-jacket,2022-02-19 12:37:34,1,"It can be what you want it to be. Deliverables to school are a PowerPoint and a report. You receive no feedback. Employer fills out a survey at end. 

My complaint is they should allow practicum to be replaced with a class, as I felt like I paid $2k to watch some videos and do my normal job (except for the deliverables with no feedback).

Many people who did the GT projects on teams really enjoyed them. My challenge there was I was working fulltime in a new job, so doing work for another company would have been terrible for my WLB."

It is disappointing to find out we don’t get any feedback. This is total career change for me, so feedback would be very beneficial, but I guess it’s ultimately the feedback and experience from the sponsor that really matters."

But it sounds like you were in a ""beggars can't be choosers"" situation, so now it just comes down to making the best of it while you're there.

It'd be strange for a metro area's LGBTQ+ health organization to not be currently doing any ongoing surveillance or related work relating to monkeypox right now, do you know if they are involved in that sort of work? If so, you might ask to be assigned tasks relating to that.

Otherwise, since it's a requirement for the degree, just do the work and move on, I'd say. I had to do 1200 internship hours for my RD, about 400 of which were in an area I had literal zero interest in learning about, the other 800 were interesting but not directly applicable to my career goals, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do to get that credential/degree. Do their tasks/do a good job, and practice your epi skills in your spare time so you're sharp when you leave. You can find lots of data to play with [here.](https://data.cdc.gov/) Keep a portfolio of what you do both at the internship and in your spare time to show to future employers."

Part of the issue is that you are very low level, and most workplaces don't have a ton of important/interesting work left over to throw at an intern; if they do, their hiring practices & workload management for their regular staff must be really poor. We always hire a summer intern, and thinking up projects for them is super difficult- every task with importance is accounted for. 

Like others said, it is what you make it. As long as you can report out on it and it will allow you to graduate, it was technically a success"

Write down bullet points about what you feel like you’re missing and what areas you would like to explore. If you haven’t already, tactfully, explain all of this to your supervisor. Ask them to be more accessible. See if they’re able to put you in contact with other persons so you can broaden your educational experience and gain additional skills. 

You are negotiating your experience. You can negotiate in a paying job. You can definitely negotiate within an unpaid opportunity where you’re looking to do things for an organization as a volunteer. 

Advocate for yourself! It may be nerve wracking but again, you’ll likely have to do this later on in your professional or academic career. If you need more assistance, DM me! Or ask someone in your program about how to have your educational needs fulfilled."

I’m not sure how your program is, but we used our practicum experience and deliverables as part of our capstone project so it would really hurt students when a practicum experience was less than favorable later on.

Part of my MPH program director’s job was to ensure practicum placements adhered to their contract. She was specifically concerned with this because our contracts with these organizations specified that the experience and deliverables had to meet certain CEPH concentration competencies. If your practicum is not meeting these competencies, perhaps they can step in to mediate so that you can get back on track."

Like being in epi and being more into the quantitative side of things, it might be beneficial for you to see ""the other side"" of things because it'll give you perspective. I'm sure simply by being there you are picking up on real PH issues in the LGBTQ community. 

Honestly though I'm sorry you're not getting the experience you want. Hopefully reframing the situation helps you trudge through it.

I was placed in health promotion because it’s where I currently worked, but my concentration was in environmental health. Halfway through we had our “mid-way meeting” and it was determined the project I was working on only met foundational competencies so we tailored it more to environmental health by taking an environmental policy approach to an issue pertaining to type 2 diabetes.

Our program is built with an assumption that folks have relatively minimum exposure to PH. Out of the 12 classes (4 foundational, 4 certificate competency, & 4 electives), I think only 6 of them have been mostly new information — HOWEVER, my degree was essentially free and I could choose some classes out of personal interest that weren’t challenging.

Keep in mind that budgeting is not easy in Korea, as there's so much to do, see, and eat all the time XD"
xhn2jo,ip0n202,Brentan1984,2022-09-19 02:59:40,0,Start by hitting up Google. Literally all the info can be found there within 5 minutes.
xhn2jo,ip1k9eq,uReallyShouldTrustMe,2022-09-19 09:23:56,3,"I was surprised too but these programs do exist. Someone I worked with a few years back told me that during her bachelors, she actually came to do her practicum in Korea (Canadian school too). I don’t know any more details than that."
xhn2jo,ip96e3t,sawazaddy,2022-09-20 22:22:45,2,"Thank you so much for your response and especially for the tip about verifying with the embassy about VISAS! I've never been out of Canada before and going abroad is pretty overwhelming because it's completely new to me. 

I've emailed a few international schools and unfortunately haven't had any luck. I understand you're probably not comfortable sharing which exact school you did your practicum at, but would you be willing to specify what kind of area it was located in? I'm just wondering if I might have a better chance of securing a placement in a rural area vs an urban one so that I can narrow my search :)"
xhn2jo,itki2bu,soksb,2022-10-24 09:29:31,1,"I'm so sorry! For some reason Reddit didn't tell me about your reply until just now... 

I hope this is still useful
We were at an international school in Busan (I chose Busan because I'd lived there before). We contacted them directly to verify it was a possibility, then our university was in contact, and secured our spots as interns."
yvo3bl,iwivbem,SnooRabbits4042,2022-11-15 23:22:37,1,It depends every year on what sites are willing to take on a student. For this year the most northern site is peace river and the most southern site is cardston. As well as there are a few sites in BC. There are limited spots around Edmonton (about 40mins to a bit over an hour) so if you’re wanting to stay close to Edmonton during clinical I wouldn’t advise picking this program. Hope this helps!

xkizw0,ipegbrq,aeropressin,2022-09-21 23:44:29,1,The U of A does an integrated dietetic internship which is guaranteed to students once they enter the nutrition major in the ?2nd year of their undergrad. The other poster is right that contacting the internship program coordinator is the way to go.
xwyn45,irasjf8,mfoley24,2022-10-06 16:34:38,4,Start by looking at descriptions of internships that interest you.  See what skills they are asking for.  You have a few months to start learning.  You can find a lot of free info online to self teach something like excel.  Your customer service experience will also go a long way for you.  You PH advisor and Career Pathways can help you frame your retail and food service experience in a way that relates to future internships.  You got this!
xwyn45,irculg4,Excellent-Tax-8539,2022-10-07 01:51:18,3,I was worried about this too so don’t worry I gotchu. The practicum sites are already aware that most of the students will have little to no experience and are opened to everyone. The key part though you demonstrate to them in the interview and cover letter why you’re a good fit them and what made you interested in applying to that site. I have no experience myself like actually NO experience and was able to get the position through the interview. Just make sure to reach out early even now tbh because the one I got the only openings they had was for spring. So don’t worry you got this! I hoped this helped :)!
xwyn45,ircuznt,Familiar-Day54,2022-10-07 01:54:34,1,Thank you I will definitely look into that!
xwyn45,ircuxgc,Familiar-Day54,2022-10-07 01:54:03,1,"This definitely makes me feel better, thank you soo much!"
y3tek2,iucckqh,ImportanceTop751,2022-10-30 06:43:14,1,I am also interested in private practice in rec therapy! In my state you have to have a master’s degree to practice independently (MSRT). That’s my next step. I’ve had my CTRS for about 1.5 years. It kind of feels like uncharted territory (private practice in RT). Im going to talk to one of my professors from school who was able to start a business in RT.
wx2sv9,ilot03k,smugmisswoodhouse,2022-08-25 03:34:44,4,"I have *never* heard of paid practicums and faculty at my university said paid internships were possible, but ""basically a unicorn."""
wx2sv9,ilrz8sp,wright571,2022-08-25 19:53:02,3,"As people previously noted practicums are different than internships (though my MSW program did refer to the practicumship as an internship). 
We do have one or two places locally that offer a stipend while completing your practicumship with them. Usually this isn't much and isn't an hourly wage. Often this requires you to work at that organization after completing the practicum if offered a job. Sometimes it requires working additional hours past what the school requires."
wx2sv9,ilop6gl,Outrageous_Mind1352,2022-08-25 03:02:44,5,Practicum is different than internship.  I would be SUPER surprised if you found a paid practicum.  Less surprised about a paid internship but it is uncommon.  I’m curious where you are looking that you found a paid internship that makes the rates public.
wx2sv9,ilplxxd,-Luminary-,2022-08-25 09:14:46,2,The only way I’ve seen people get paid practicums is if they complete their hours at the place they are already working it.
wx2sv9,ilta24n,sunnycmg,2022-08-26 01:23:46,2,My last semester of internship I was hired as an administrative assistant to help with the files. Maybe a similar set up is a possibility
wx2sv9,ilov4v0,DoctorSweetheart,2022-08-25 03:53:32,1,"Internship and practicum are completely different.  Paid internships are typically, practicum are not. Many programs won't allow paid practicum."
wx2sv9,imbddn0,_heidster,2022-08-29 22:48:00,1,"I am late responding to this, and you got great comments already but I'll add my experience. Internships are typically in undergrad, and practicum is during your master's and a more intensive style of experience. I was not paid for either of my internships. I was not paid for my one-semester generalist practicum, but I was paid for my two-semester clinical practicum."
wx2sv9,ilopj50,iliketoreddit91,2022-08-25 03:05:37,1,"Ok, I see. I assumed the two words were interchangeable. Thank you for clarifying; helps me to set more realistic expectations."

wx2sv9,iloxqvs,iliketoreddit91,2022-08-25 04:17:47,1,Thank you for your response. I don’t understand why the practicum needs to be unpaid though.
wx2sv9,iloyqul,DoctorSweetheart,2022-08-25 04:27:29,2,"Practicum is usually for class credit. While clinical experience is the point, it's a learning experience more than work experience   A supervisor is fully responsible for all work,  and a *good* supervisor puts lots of work into training."
y2qwcu,is5po30,DoctorSweetheart,2022-10-13 14:24:05,5,"Have you talked to your clinical training director?  It is their job to find a training opportunity for you, and your program should already partner with training sites.

If you are interested in psychedelic assisted therapy,  that's more of a research area. It's not legal yet- even in places where it is legal, the programs are still rolling out."
y2qwcu,is670ql,catteeth26,2022-10-13 16:20:33,1,Thank you yes - we have a list of approved sites but I am interested in folks' actual experiences working at these sites since the director has not worked at all of these places themself.

Hopefully it's still just too early, and organizations in your field are aware of the situation and start posting in October/November. I'd recommend talking to students in your program who are a year ahead of you, see what they did!"

wikjlu,ijdd7k5,Top_Tax8407,2022-08-07 22:55:45,2,Checking in from MN... Starting mine in January and also having these feelings!
wikjlu,ijdxufl,No-Loss6626,2022-08-08 01:36:36,2,"I did my practicum/internship at a CPS school too! Mine was k-8 (wasn’t used to that coming from Iowa). I would echo what has been said about building relationships with students and staff. Some people may not agree with me, but especially when you’re starting and May not have a lot to do/it can feel awkward, I would jump in and help places like lunch room/recess. This will allow you to build relationships with not only kids but also support staff who might really need it. I had two great counselors that were open about telling me what they expected. I would figure out up front what they expect and have them help you figure out how to make that happen. I also made it a point to try and get to know the principal up front. I was scared as hell of her, but you wanna put yourself out there early & be seen as helpful/dependable! Also make sure that you are no doing TOO much aka set boundaries within what you need for your program/learning as well as personally. I also put on a school wide job fair at the end of my time and with that (hoping to focus not just in college but also CAREER) I made a point to bring in community resources and neighborhood schools (even those seem as “bad” 🙀) to make sure that many options were visible to students. Even if you don’t do a fair like me, getting to know the stuff nearby in the community is important, I feel. Also attend events!!!!! Great way to get to know families & community!!! Ok that’s a lot. And Im sure there is more. Basically integrate to the school, be present, and take care of yourself! Good luck!!!"
wikjlu,ijdyht0,Curlsandskin,2022-08-08 01:41:45,2,Learn as much as you can and take photos of anything you do. Ex: I created charts for the counseling office on mental health. Try to learn as much as you can even with the technology aspect of counseling. Ask questions if your not clear about anything counselors will answer and guide you. Add anything you do to your portfolio so when you begin applying you can showcase all you've done. Keep your relationships positive with the counselors and admin. You can use them as references. Wishing you the best of luck! It is nerve wrecking but you'll love it once you begin.
wikjlu,ijc86qz,RateNo2829,2022-08-07 18:12:59,5,"I agree! Once you begin to feel “a part of the team” your confidence will grow tremendously and in turn you’ll be more confident in your actual work with students and with teachers. In my experience, it took up until the last month/ month & a half of the semester to feel this level of confidence but as I go into internship in the next few weeks I’m hoping that I’m not starting from scratch. Best of luck!"
wikjlu,ijdgu5i,Catwoman1003,2022-08-07 23:23:05,2,"I also agree! I would say take time building relationships not just with students, but staff also. Greet the office staff, eat lunch with the teachers, befriend other staff like school psychs, SLP's, custodians, etc."

I’ve also not been very natural at the administrative side, having my notes returned to me over and over with questions I could have asked in session, unclear wording, and missing information. I’ve felt like a real dumb dumb a lot over the past couple months. 

Yesterday I talked to a fellow practicum student at the site and she told me she’s been struggling in the same areas. I realized that part of what made the process so difficult is that there was a lot I needed to improve at and when my supervisor was (rightfully) letting me know,I had no way of knowing if this deluge of correction/instruction was par for the course or if I was the worst practicum intern ever. And before talking to the other practicum intern, it really felt like I was just the worst ever. 

So if that’s how you’re feeling, I’m here to tell you, I’m strugglin’ with the notes, too. You’re not alone. It’s part of the process of getting better. Chin up, buttercup :)"
