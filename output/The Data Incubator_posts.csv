**Some extra notes:**

* The classes are hosted remotely for both.
* WeCloudData is Canada-based, but they have students from the US (and I am from the US)
* The tools/technologies they teach in the classroom are the same and up-to-date, only difference is that DataStack Academy entirely focuses on GCP whereas WeCloudData also teaches AWS.
* I can't find much alumni review on DataStack Academy, but they have partnered up with Epicodus which I heard it's a good school.  The job placement rate is from Epicodus website."

I suppose the question of why I was only there for four months might come up, so I'll post my take of it below. The resume-relevant part is that it's difficult to put any kind of business results/impact because while I wrote a lot of code for them, none of it saw production while I was there.  


Some other thoughts:

* the blurb at the top under ""Data Engineer"" seems too long
* get rid of ""Signature Competencies"" and put ""Technical Proficiencies"" in its place
* the ""Associate Data Engineer"" section from Manulife seems unwieldy, even though it has the most relevant data-engineer-type stuff in it

Why I was there for only four months:  


 I felt that their demands were unrealistic; they're very new to the world of data, and they wanted a fully automated salesforce ETL pipeline in a month, scripted entirely with python and MySQL. I was the only data engineer in the org, and I had no team and no one to consult with or bounce ideas off of. When I did my job interview with the supervisor, I told him that I didn't have any practice with python programming in my last job, so he should have known that I wouldn't be able to whip out code like a pro. The only other python guy there was too busy and my manager told me not to bother him. I was only with them for four months.  


On my last 1:1 my manager gave me a 4/5 and my resume shows that I've received promotions at other jobs in the past.

zn1vhc,weclouddata,Best DE Bootcamp based on my experience and objectives?,dataengineering,StrikeSaber47,2022-12-16 00:57:43,3,"Hey, I know I am one of those people that had to create another DE bootcamp thread but I would love to get some advice on which DE bootcamp that would suit me the best for my next steps in my career.

I am currently working full time as a Business Analysis Manager at a Fortune 500 tech company in the Bay Area for the last five years. In this role, I have been acting as a Swiss Army Knife of sorts being a half-PM and a half-DA specializing in developing data quality, integration, and automation solutions that I then pass onto a BI or a DS team to actually develop in production for us. Most of the data is related to sales and is often anchored by our CRM (SFDC) and with no-code intermediate solutions (such as LeanData or SFDC Flows). From time to time, I do prototype out custom scripts that could be used to fulfill some functionality (like connecting to Snowflake and SAP), but ultimately the ETL solutions I draft are pushed to actual DE's and Dev's to fully build out. I also maintain reports and dashboards on our data health and do the typical update meetings to our stakeholders.

However in the past half a year, I have been wanting to go more towards the path of being a pure BI Analyst, AE, or DE. I have SQL and Tableau knowledge (as I still have to do analysis and prototyping) and some Python knowledge, but not enough to be a reliable scripter. Furthermore, I have no hands-on knowledge of deeper things like Data Lakehouses or Data Orchestration as my job does not require me to use those directly (again we got DE's and Dev's for that). Therefore, I am considering a bootcamp to help fill those gaps and hopefully get me caught up on the technical stack of my skills and sharp enough to pass technical interviews for future BI roles.

Currently, I am looking at three in particular, but each of them has a different approach to how they teach:

1. Jigsaw Labs
2. Data Engineering Camp
3. WeCloudData

Jigsaw Labs: 

A six month course that teaches 'Data Engineering' from a SWE perspective of knowing how to write efficient and well designed Python and SQL code to properly do large-scale ETL processes and only in the second half of the course to focus on Cloud Computing (AWS) and Data Pipelines using Airflow, Fivetran and DBT. According to some of my friends in the DE and Data Infra space that this course is the most useful as the key to being a solid BI/AE/DE is knowing how to write effective Python code and SQL queries that follows a good data design and everything from there should come naturally.

This course is also the most expensive of the three and also includes an externship that you can work with an actual company or non-profit to apply the taught skills to build a real-world applied project and gives an additional nine months of post-course support, especially in sharpening your Python/SQL LC practice for those interviews.

However, the course does not cover anything with Data Lakehouses or Data Streaming, I feel like the most you will be out of the course is a solid BI Analyst, but you will still need to cover the gaps of the rest on your own, which makes me question how much worth I will be for my career switch in the future to like an AE.

Data Engineering Camp:

They have been touted pretty well in this subreddit and the course founder is pretty active on this subreddit as well. His course is the shortest of the three and he seems to cover all of the key bits in the DE toolbox and expectations including Lakehouses (Spark, Databricks) and Streaming (Kafka). However, I am not sure all of this coverage would make me come out of it effective enough to be taken seriously for a career change without further supplementation. It sounds it is great if I wanted to be like a TPM that would work more with an AE/DE team though.

Also from a instruction POV, I will have to take classes between 2AM to 5AM since I am in the West Coast US and they are being taught from Australia.

WeCloudData:

This one seems to be in the middle of Jigsaw Labs and DEC. It is six months and seems to cover all of the basis that Jigsaw and DEC is doing, but not in the detail on the Python/SQL front like Jigsaw. Therefore, I feel like this one will get me the good grasp of what I need to know as an AE/DE, but I am leery if it still lacks the best approach to give me the core foundations needed for my Python/SQL chops. They also provide six months of mentorship and career prep after the course but not externship if you do the part-time program.

Therefore, I am torn if I trade off the philosophy of Jigsaw Labs to teach you the true fundamentals but at the expense of learning the higher-level tools/processes that is also needed, or do a more comprehensive curriculum like DEC or WeCloudData coming from my own experience and aspirations.

Any suggestions is appreciated as I want to do the best bootcamp that would yield me the best foot forward for my next career move. I know a good number of you would tell me to don't bother with any of them and just self-learn (cheaper), but trust me, I learn the best by being instructed, especially if I want to be taught the foundations correctly.

Thx!"

I have now reduced it to one page and put as much quantifiable impact as I felt I could. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to improve the yourehired-ness of this thing.

I wanted to have my projects integrated with the rest of the resume, but that would significantly boost the word count. I suppose I'll have to settle for a link at the top(?). Maybe I could take out the Education stuff instead?

xiodrj,weclouddata,Career Shifter - Bootcamp Opinions,dataengineering,klailatimad,2022-09-19 20:53:40,6,"Hi

I've been looking into different data engineering bootcamps that are suited for the Eastern Time Zone and that will begin in the next few weeks / few months as I am currently living in Ontario, Canada. I am currently unemployed and can afford to pay most of these tuition fees. For context, I used to work in operations and had technical roles (non software) in Oil and Gas.

My goal is to land a job in data engineering. 

So the content of the bootcamp is important, and having access to either internships or access to recruiters (through the bootcamp itself or to be provided by the instructors / network of people giving the course) plays a major role in me selecting the right bootcamp to increase my chances of landing a job in Ontario, Canada.

I have found the below bootcamps and would appreciate any and all feedback from someone that has taken any of these bootcamps, know someone that has gone through theses bootcamps and landed a job afterwards, or any other bootcamp recommendations.

vh20md,weclouddata,Need advice weather data engineering program is a good idea for diversifying technical skills,dataengineering,GypsyElder,2022-06-21 02:02:44,2,"Hi everyone!

I’m considering a data engineering program that’s about six months in length part-time. I currently work as a statistical programmer/analyst at a pharmaceutical company. 

I just accepted a new job as a manager of programming, but this is during a time where I am very much interested in diversifying my skill set, so that in the future, I will not be limited to working in the same industries.

I work in regulated environments (sensitive data) that do utilize different technologies and languages, but their use is generally limited compared to non or less regulated spaces. 

I know that data engineering is an evolving field. So my question is:

If I decided to complete the data engineering program now, do you think the skills learned during the process would be obsolete by the time I decide to switch over to engineering?

I originally planned to completely switch careers last year, but I was presented with this opportunity within the same industry. So, I am willing to work this position for a while. But in the meantime, I want to advance my technical skills. 

I’m not short on cash; the program is $6,120. 

Do you think it is worth it? Or should I just forget training until I decide to make the move?"

I've been looking into the possibility of getting into a career in Big Data but am not sure how to proceed. I was outsourced out of my previous job - NAS data storage - and was having no luck finding a job in that field. I heard about Big Data and was intrigued but I'm starting to wonder if it's doable without a university degree.

I took a Big Data Developer course from Simplilearn and I think I kind of got burned. They did an ok job of teaching the basics and the overall concepts but I still don't know what I feel I need to know about processing and sorting data, whether through Hadoop or Spark. My only programming background is being halfway through a book on Python and I feel like if I'm going to get anywhere with Spark/Hadoop I would need something that's very ""this command does this"", hands-on kind of training.

There's a local company called ""We Cloud Data"" that offers courses:

http://weclouddata.com/courses/

They have an info session on Saturday that I intend to check out, but I question whether a proficiency in Big Data can be taught in 12 courses.

* >!During the return trip to Earth, his experience seeing the world from so far away caused within him a sudden epiphany about life and the universe.  He describes it this way:  ""You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, 'Look at that, you son of a bitch.'""!<

* >!He later  became founding chairman of the Institute of Noetic Sciences in 1973 for the purpose of consciousness research and other ""related phenomena"".  He said ""Science and religion have lived on opposite sides of the street now for hundreds of years.

Body and mind, physicality and consciousness belong to the same side of reality."" !<

10usyl2,practicum,Astrology Practicum #11 | February 5 - 12,astrology,EuphoricToe1,2023-02-06 00:50:31,12,"Hello and welcome to the 11th Astrology Practicum! Please feel free to contribute your thoughts no matter if you are a seasoned astrologer or a beginner. I am relatively new to my studies myself and will do my best to offer feedback to your notes, as well as my own delineations at the end of the week when the native's identity is revealed.

Here are links to the native's chart, which has a Rodden rating of AA:

* [Placidus](https://imgur.com/a/V91ezoN)
* [Whole Sign](https://imgur.com/a/2C7XHgr)

Please answer the following questions, and *don't forget to explain how you reached your conclusions using what you see in the chart:*

1. Personality- what are some traits and qualities that the native exhibits?
2. Career- what line of work is the native in, and what are they known for?
3. Marriage and children- is the native married and/or a parent and, if so to either, what is the nature of those relationships?

Looking forward to reading everyone's thoughts. Have fun!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revealing the native's identity! This chart belongs to >!David Lynch, a well-known writer and director for television and film. He is perhaps most recognized for his cult classic TV show Twin Peaks, although he's also directed several cult classic movies like Eraserhead.!<

>!The three things that strongly stand out to me are his AC in Scorpio, his Pluto in Leo in his 10H, and his Moon conjunct his MC. Lynch has a consistent interest in darker themes (Twin Peaks being a murder mystery/crime drama), as well as counter-cultural and somewhat taboo topics. The sex scenes on one of his movies, Blue Velvet, have been described as ""the sickest ever."" With his Mars in Cancer, and conjunct his Saturn, the intensity of Mars' drive is somewhat softened and ""lunarized"" (totally just invented that word). His work (and, indeed, his countenance) has a somewhat dream-like quality- Chris Brennan's episode of The Astrology Podcast focusing on Cancer has a great breakdown of the Cancerian/lunar quality that describes Lynch's aesthetic quite well. With his Moon on his MC, it's no wonder this quality is so present in his work. Plus, with Pluto where it is in his chart, he has no qualms with putting these darker themes through the lunar lens in the spotlight.!<

As someone noted below, >!David Lynch's!< chart is remarkably similar to >!Dolly Parton's,!< as they appear to have been born a few hours apart from one another! Personally, I can't imagine two people more different, which is such a fantastic example of how time of birth (and, thus, house placement) can make a massive difference of the expression of planets in the same signs.

Absolutely incredible work to everyone who contributed! I really do learn so much from these. I'm nominating u/ilovelamp011001 to helm the next practicum, if they are willing!"
111czys,practicum,Only Practicum + Simulation Remaining Advice on how to finish,OMSA,SgtSlice,2023-02-13 16:16:31,15,"Hi all; after this semester I will only have two courses remaining. Simulation and the Practicum. I have 4.0 GPA currently.

I was originally thinking about taking Simulation in the summer and Practicum in the Fall and finishing this year.

My math is not super strong. I took CDA, and really struggled through the derivations. Luckily I had a week to finish those and it wasn’t in a test environment so I could use all sorts of online resources to help me understand the math without time pressure. I ended up getting an A in the class, but it was hard work.

I was thinking maybe I take the Summer off and do the Practicum together with Simulation in Fall2023? How difficult is the Practicum to pair with a class for those who’ve done it? I guess it matters what topic you pick.

My goals are to finish as soon as possible with as little stress/headache at this point. I love the program, I’m just ready to have free time again 😁

Also was thinking maybe I go Practicum in the summer and then simulation in Fall? Simulation is probably the more intense, might be better to do it in a normal semester than condensed.

Happy to hear your thoughts."
10zwrnb,practicum,Is it normal to feel this way in practicum (ON)?,CanadianTeachers,throwaway0967183,2023-02-11 20:14:31,31,"I’m a second year teachers college student in Ontario, and I still feel lots of discomfort in my practicum. I try hard to hide it, but the feeling of constantly being judged and evaluated is so stressful. I find I just can’t get into my groove in my placement because I frequently worry about what my associate teacher thinks of me. And in general, it’s harder to perform when someone is watching over you and evaluating your lessons. 

I have my temporary certificate and I occasionally supply teach on my day off. I feel much more comfortable when I’m on my own supply teaching.

Btw, I really appreciate my associate teacher—I’m not the type to get defensive over feedback. I actually really appreciate him taking the time to watch my lessons and offer me advice! I just always worry about overstepping or doing things wrong. And I feel like I can’t be myself. I’m trying my best, but I feel my lessons can be cringe, lol. 

Any advice on managing this stress?"
10ryydr,practicum,"practicum clients are ""difficult""",slp,Carmen_CarMel,2023-02-02 19:49:12,6,"My clients are all kids with asd ages 7 and under but developmentally 16 - 48 months. Most are non verbal and the verbal ones refuse, I mean REFUSE, to speak. They rarely imitate and if they do speak its echolailic and generally when we (practicum partner and I) are not paying attention or otherwise trying to engage them. Last semester I had similar kids but my supervisor was physically present and really broke the ice then handed them over. My new supervisor is virtual and can't help as much, and just advises to target engagement through play and learning a few key gestures / words. Which we try but these kids do not engage, if they like something they want it in isolation and the behaviours are so big. It's honestly discouraging me because what am I doing wrong, I'm trying every toy, every song.
It's not been all bad and we've had some moments where we can go yay! But even then half the time they never do it again and even hate the activity they just loved.
Idk what to do and any advice would be great, please don't beat me up, I'm doing my best and think as a student I need to ask for help before I become a clueless clinician."

 **ANSWER! :)**

>!Okay all! Sorry for the late announcement of the winner! I wanted to give more time for more responses but here we are! lol !<

>!This is the chart of Hugh Hefner! !<

>!I’m a beginner myself so I'm limited in how in-depth my chart interpretation is, apologies!!<

>!Personality: We have a Aries Sun and Virgo Rising, which stands out immediately to me as a very contradicting combo, as someone who comes off as a stable, practical and reliable person that is calm, collected and organized, who’s core personality is really impulsive, childish and short tempered and add in the fact his sun is exalted in Aries and Mercury, the ruler of the first house is also in Aries with the sun both in the 8th house, the house of other people's money, sex, death. !<

>!Relationships: Hugh Hefner was a sex obsessed man who seemed to have it all together, a woman lover with many lovers and many girlfriends, a calculated man in control. Since his death it’s been revealed he was really a nightmare to the women he was close to. Holly Madison even wrote a book describing the horrific things she had endured. He was a destructive force to all of those close to him, Sun Square pluto in the 11th house. Pluto being in cancer, with its ruler, the moon in the 7th house, he was very good at manipulating everyone into believing he had good intentions, despite how obvious it should’ve been.!<

>!Career: Simply, 10th house in Gemini, The ruler of Gemini being Mercury sitting in the 8th house with the sun, all adds up for the 8th house (sex) Mercury (Playboy Magazine) His sun, all in aries (Public presentation) !<

>!Themes: The general over vibe from the chart I get is a impulsive childish person, with a charming quality with a talent for manipulating, hypersexual or morbid curiosity oriented social butterfly, issues with not being able to be alone, silver tongued, he can communicate and convince someone of anything, very persuasive. Relationship focused, never single or never single for long, known for their relationships or sex scandals!<

>!Death: Hugh hefner died of cardiac arrest caused by sepsis brought on by E. Coli infection.!<

>!I’m not familiar with death interpretation so this is a shot in the dark but I took Jupiter, the planet of growth and expansion, in the 6th house of health, with Mars the planet of action/aggression/conflict, leads me to the rapid growth of the infection thus resulting in his death, i’m sure there's more things too take into account here, i’m just not confident in this area yet haha.!<

>!The winner of this practicum is..EuphoricToe1! Congrats! You’re welcome to host the next practicum, if you’re not up for it just let me know and someone else can take the reins if they’d like! :)!<"
117h2ho,practicum,Are Practicums Paid? (In Canada if that helps),ClinicalPsychology,RatPumpkin,2023-02-20 18:50:36,5,"I’ve seen conflicting answers on this but I’m looking to know are practicums in clinical psych PhD programs paid? I’m in Canada so if you know about Canada great, if not even just learning about other countries I can try and prepare myself. 

Im currently finishing up another degree in which I have an unpaid practicum, the course I’m in right now requires about 65 hours of work a week not including travel between in class and in practicum and balancing this while trying to work to even pay for the gas for travel is quite literally starting to kill me. I did not apply this cycle between finishing this degree, needing time to breathe and not having the money. 

I’ve been working towards clinical psych for years and even if the pay is peanuts that would be a huge relief compared to have to do this for the next 6 years
Thanks and good luck !"

I just don’t think I’m going to be able to handle all the responsibilities given to a school counselor. When we sit in class and talk about all the programs and lessons students have created and ran at their Practicum site it just makes me nervous. I don’t even know where I would begin. I’ve never considered myself a leader or have even wanted to be. Creating my own classroom lessons sounds like hell. I’m very comfortable just being told what my duties are and doing it. I’m so not ready to run my own programming. I’m worried I wasted lots of time and money pursuing this. I’m not sure what I’m looking for here. Words of encouragement? Or maybe for someone to just say quit now? This program has been insightful but also kind of miserable. I’m so exhausted.
101wadh,practicum,What actions are being taken regarding the exploitation of Psychology grad program practicums?,psychologystudents,PsyD2B,2023-01-03 03:03:26,81,"I am currently applying for my first practicum, and I continually see discussion on Reddit, quora, and among many doctoral students regarding the sheer lunacy of how we have to work 1000 hours for an entire year for free. 

They expect us to be there three days a week for 8-hour days, some sites want you on the weekend, and this is all on top of a full-time class load and research. I currently work 10 hours a week and can get by with loans, but losing the ability and autonomy to make a living for myself and working for free IN THIS ECONOMY ... WITH THIS INFLATION... is ridiculous. 

I am very much over hearing people say, ""It is all part of the process- everyone goes through it"" -- like yeah, they did go through it when education was half the cost it is now, cost of living was actually attainable, and you didn't have to work multiple jobs to SURVIVE and make ends meat. 

This rant is because I have seen a lot of discussion around the absurdity of exploiting grad students and making them work for free, but what is ACTUALLY being done to change this? I don't know where to start or what to do, but someone needs to get the ball rolling because in doctoral programs, we have 3 PRACTICUMS BACK TO BACK FOR 3 YEARS..... so.... I'm just not supposed to work for three years? or am I just supposed to stop eating, sleeping, and taking care of myself? I don't see why obtaining a doctoral degree in CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY warrants the destruction of one's mental health and well-being. There has got to be some middle ground or something to start this change...

Point being?? Higher education is a classist and oppressive scam that is intended to be for the wealthy and basically nobody else who doesn't make over 100+ K a year or have almost half a million dollars in their savings account."
114clg5,practicum,Anorexic client at practicum not dedicated to eating disorders,therapists,tantatulla,2023-02-17 06:25:10,6,"I am a 2nd year grad student in a practicum that is not an eating disorder clinic and I don’t have experience working with eating disorders. I did an intake with the father of a teen who has a BMI of 16 and father reports him not wanting to eat because he doesn’t want to be seen eating.  He also has other symptoms. I asked my supervisor if I should refer them out an she said no do a first session and do intake then we can see if we need to refer him out. To me based on his BMI he needs specific anorexia support I cant provide.

I just finished day 9 and I'm very overwhelmed with how little I know and I'm sensing that I should be picking things up faster than I am. Navigating through Epic, doing chart reviews efficiently, and completing documentation are proving to be so difficult to learn. I've never worked in a medical setting before and I'm questioning if I'm smart enough for it. Everything is so new all the time, and because I'm in acute care, I can't reference previous notes that my supervisor has approved because patients move on and off caseload so quickly. I'm a pretty sensitive person and it's hard for me to be so out of my comfort zone and feel like I'm disappointing people by not meeting expectations quickly. My supervisor is nice but I'm just sensing this week that if I've been exposed to something then I should know it by now. Is there anything that really helped others learn quickly?

**!!!ANSWERS!!!**

>!CHART NATIVE: Fridah Kahlo!!<

>!Born: July 6 1907 @ 8:30am in Coyoacán, Mexico.!<

—

>!Let's start with the topic of health first (6H), because this was critical to the life of Frida Kahlo.!<

>!This is a diurnal chart, thus the nocturnal malefic (Mars) is seen as the bigger trouble maker for the native (rather than Saturn). Placed in the 6H this would be a primary indicator of health complications. Mars likes to be violent/aggressive/dramatic. In the 6H it would indicate intense and acute health accidents.!<

>!The planetary ruler of her 4H is Mars, which would tie her childhood to her 6H. At the age of 6 she became infected with polio. This disease resulted in the permanent crippling of her right leg (which had a severe impact on her childhood, because she was then subject to bullying for her limp).!<

>!Uranus conjunct Mars could probably be seen in the “freak accident” that happened to her when she was 18. Automobiles (in the 1920s) were a new technology revolutionizing life for the masses. She was involved in a terrible automobile accident while riding the public bus. The handrail of the bus entered through her abdomen and exited through her vagina. She was left with a broken spinal column, a broken collarbone, a broken pelvis, and several broken ribs. Her right leg was fractured in 11 places, her right foot was dislocated and crushed, and her shoulder was dislocated.!<

>!Her wounds caused her to be completely bedridden for the next 9 months and she was in a full body cast. She would undergo approximately 30 surgical operations in her lifetime (most of which were not super helpful).!<

>!Frida says that her entire life changed after this moment. In fact, she even described the effect that this event had on her life as like “lightning” (talk about a Uranus placement)!!<

>!Mars being opposite her Sun (the planet of vitality) is further evidence for the health issues and chronic pain she faced. Such a placement can also indicate a shorter life span (she died at 47).!<

—

>!Let’s jump across the chart to her 12H.!<

>!Most noticeably is the Sun conjunct Neptune placement. Such a placement would indicate someone with a complicated, changing, and abstract sense of self. I find Neptune is also a good indicator of art (which is the universal language that can bridge boundaries), so this placement surely added to her artistic personality. Featured in her artwork were often surrealist self portraits exploring the many different versions of herself.!<

>!Being in the 12H, Frida spent a lot of her life in isolation and in institutions. After her accident she spent most of her life in the hospital. She struggled a lot with feeling lonely. The polarizing dynamic between her physical health and her mental health can be seen in the opposition between her 12H and 6H placements. Clearly, she struggled back and forth her whole life between physical pain and mental pain.!<

>!The placement of Jupiter here could perhaps be the planet that led her to art. As the planet of good fortune and luck and self growth, she only really found art and connected with it after her accident. She had nothing else to do but stay in bed, so she took up painting! This demonstrates the activation of Jupiter as a result of her becoming isolated. Often the most critical works of art that she produced were generated during these prolonged periods of time alone.!<

>!Additionally, the influence of Jupiter in the 12H can be seen through her substance abuse. Seeking an escape from her constant pain, Frida developed addictions to opiates, alcohol, and tobacco. 12H Jupiter is a great indicator of her inclination toward over indulgence in self destructive behaviors and substances.!<

—

>!Now let’s examine her 1H and 10H!!<

>!Her Leo AC was quite prominent. As a child she attended the National Preparatory School in Mexico City, and she was 1 of only 35 female students at the time. She became rather famous among her peers as being especially outspoken and brave. In fact, her future spouse, Diego Rivera, said that the confidence and ""strange fire in her eyes"" were the first things he noticed about her when he met her as a student. !<

>!Her 1H Leo Mercury is a significant placement. This is a huge pointer towards her being an artist. This house is ruled by the Sun, which is placed in the 12H. Thus the themes she often tried to communicate and express through her art were tied to her experiences in the 12H. As mentioned above, a lot of her work centered on surrealism and self portraits exploring her pain!!<

>!In her 10H we see a loose conjunction between her Moon and MC. This would indicate a career tied to her emotions and personal life as well as her body! Her art focused heavily on these themes. She became quite famous for her expressive and profoundly emotional paintings.!<

>!She became so successful, that she was the very first Mexican painter to ever be featured in the Louvre museum in Paris!!<

>!The 10H is ruled by Venus, which is another indicator of artistic endeavors!!<

—

>!That segues well into our next topic: relationships.!<

>!Her Venus (ruler of the 10H) was placed in the 11H. This is a good indicator that she met her love interest within a social / group / political setting. Frida joined the Mexican Communist Party in 1927, and it was here that she met (or rather reconnected with) the artist Diego Rivera. Not only did they connect via politics, but they were contemporaries of each other. Two artists who occupied similar artistic social circles within Mexico at the time.!<

>!Notably, her Venus is conjunct Pluto. This placement indicates a very intense and dramatic relationship. Pluto being the planet of death and rebirth, their relationship reflected this very clearly. They remained partners throughout her life, but had many ups and downs. They even got married twice! This relationship was constantly dying off and being reborn! !<

>!Throughout their back and forth marriage, both Frida and Diego had many adulterous relationships. With Chiron in the 7H, Frida felt deeply alone. She often tried to fill that void by seeking diverse and exciting relationships. In fact, she was known to have slept with many people, including both men and women. In her time, her sexual identity was restricted, but now she is widely regarded as a historical LGBTQIA+ icon.!<

>!This Chiron placement, in addition to her 7H being ruled by Uranus (in the 6H), could be an additional indicator to the bullying she experienced as a child. Her physical health played a huge role in her relationships with other people. Chiron here shows the ostracization she experienced due to her physical trauma.!<

—

>!Almost done! Let’s look to her 8H house.!<

>!Saturn in the house of death is a primary indicator of death by depression and suicide. Frida was suspected to have died by suicide via opiate overdose. Her journals surrounding her last days were filled with mentions of suicide and her last entry was recorded as thus: “I hope exit is joyful and I hope never to come back.”!<

>!In other regards to the 8H, Frida spent a lot of time struggling with death and sex. She likely thought more deeply about these topics than most people and had profoundly complex perspectives and experiences with such taboo topics.!<

>!Her Saturn is well aspected to other critical placements in her chart such as her Moon/MC, Venus/Pluto, Jupiter, and Mercury. Obviously, the 12H themes heavily influenced her life and especially her artworks. (Her 12H Jupiter aspect to 8H Saturn is another connection to her death from drug overdose!)!<

—

>!Finally, let’s end by taking a peek at the 5H.!<

>!This house is empty which could indicate no children (or no significant relationship to them), but more importantly this house forms no aspects at all to either of the luminaries or Jupiter, and forms an opposition with Venus. These relationships are strong indicators of infertility / no children.!<

>!Additionally, her Saturn 8H could indicate limitations of the sexual organs. As we know, her automobile accident seriously traumatized her whole body including her sexual organs. The accident is likely responsible for the infertility she experienced. Her 6H is ruled by Saturn, so that would perfectly link the accident to her infecundity.!<

I think that is all!

Beginners and experienced astrologers alike can give it their best shot. The chart can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/z20em7m.jpg).

Please tell me:
1) what did the native do for a living?
2) Some personality traits
3) what were the marriage(s) and children relationships like?
4) Just going to be upfront this time lol. The native is deceased. How do you think the native passed away? Death astrology, forensic astrology, and medical astrology is fascinating. We can respectfully and with limitations see these things in the chart. 

Good luck!


>!The chart is that of Robin Williams, comedian, actor, and voice actor. RIP🙏!<

>!Here is my chart breakdown:!<

>!1)MC in leo. Leo energy wants to be in the spotlight and be appreciated. Really natural actor energy. Mercury in leo conjunct MC can be known for their voice and the entertaining way their mind works and use this in their career. Thus comedy and voice acting. MC/mercury conjunct leo trine jupiter in Aries would create a talker with really boisterous energy. Williams was known for frenetic and manic comedy acts where he would sweat uncontrollably. Aries and leo both being fire signs associated with mercury is someone who has ""zingers."" Mercury/MC conjunct pluto is someone who understands the psychology of people and uses that in career and someone who is transformed by their career. MC/mercury/pluto sextile neptune is someone who can really spin a story and take people to another world with their speech. People were utterly transported by his comedy and acting.!<

>!2) Cancer sun 9th house copresent with mars (ascendant ruler) and uranus. A person who is very family oriented, sensitive, moody, original, and autonomous who may have crisis of faith as a major life theme (9th house theme). Pisces moon 5th house trine mars and uranus is someone who is fun and creative who loves unconditionally but can act impulsively and erratically with their moods. Moon opposite venus is someone who has trouble feeling loved and emotionally fulfilled. Scorpio ascendant must go through painful transformations. Lots of water energy is prone to addiction and escapism, which Williams struggled with all his life.!<

>!3)For marriage, we look to the 7th house in taurus ruled by venus in virgo. Taurus 7th house wants stable and comfortable love. The house ruled by Venus in virgo lends to multiple marriages though as its in a mutable sign. Venus is also in its fall in virgo. Venus wants to keep things light and airy and overlook flaws for the sake of love. Virgo sees the flaws and must delve into things deeply and analyze every part of it. So venus does not function well here and often leads to dissatisfaction for many reasons.  Venus is also sextile mars and uranus, which are separating planets. Moon opposite venus also leads to dissatisfaction. Williams had 3 marriages. The second marriage was with the nanny and likely started while first marriage was still happening. So we can see love life was not the best. For kids, we look to the 5th house.  Moon and NN are here in pisces. Pisces loves with no boundaries and the moon means his kids were his soul and important to his lifepath. 5th house is ruled by jupiter in Aries in a day chart. Kids would be pretty lucky to him! With mutable Pisces and jupiter in Aries being cardinal, we can easily say multiple children. There were 3.!<

>!4) TW: Williams committed suicide by hanging with an underlying illness of Lewy Body Disease. For death, I look to the 8th house of death. 8th house is in gemini, which is ruled by Mercury in Leo. Gemini signifies the lungs and the nervous system among other things. Mercury also rules the nervous system and arterial system and flow of oxygen. Leo rules the vertebra. Pluto and 12th house influences can definitely point to mental anguish/suicide. With these connections we can definitely see hanging/suicide and the asphyxiation aspect of the death. Mercury is trine jupiter in Aries in 6th. Aries rules the head/cranium and jupiter can signify growth, which makes sense for Lewy Body Disease. Mercury sextile neptune in the 12th can point a hard to find illness and mental confusion which Williams had as a symptom. He was not properly diagnosed until after his death by autopsy. 6th and 12th house connections definitely point to illness involved.!<

My program requires 800 hours in two different educational settings, such as an elementary and MS. My current boss has offered me a part-time position next year while I complete this portion of my program. I know many students choose not to work but that is not an option for me currently. Therefore, I'm trying to understand how part-time I'll be able to work (if at all) at my current school. Or would I be better off subbing or offering tutoring services at night.. 

My question is, how many days a week/hours a day were you completing your intern hours? Were you able to choose the time/days you came in or was the setup for you? 

I would love to hear any of your experiences!

111b4qh,practicum,Are there volunteer opportunities to co-facilitate groups outside of practicum/internship?,therapists,descending_angel,2023-02-13 14:58:34,1,"I’m in my first semester of practicum at a telehealth site. The groups I can attend are mostly psychoeducational with slides. One of them where there is slightly more interaction has 20 ish people on at a time, the other one where there is almost zero interaction has about 10. Many people remain with their cameras off and don’t interact, like I said. Because of this set up, I wanted to see if there was a possibility of volunteering out in the real world for an hour a week to co-facilitate a group outside my site (I imagine this would be outside of my hours as well) to get better experience with this. Is this a thing? I need to stay telehealth but I wanted more of an organic experience with groups as this just seems really impersonal and I’m not learning much from it."

The thing I’m most nervous about with the classroom I’m observing is blending in with students (currently a younger-looking 23 year old female). I’ve been told by multiple professors to “dress older”, but no follow up on exactly what that might look like. Pinterest didn’t get me very far and I thought this might be the best place to ask.

My target age is middle school and I feel a little more comfortable with what I’ve found on other threads/the internet in general with that age group, so mainly just concerned about being with kids I’m not much older than.

I have been having issues falling asleep due to the level of rumination & anxiety about everything that I have to do and whats to come. 

I start my individual clients next week and there's tons of paperwork and technical things I  have to get set up before then. Just thinking about all of it is like an endless to-do list and my mind feels like it won't shut off until its all done. (I have anxiety and OCD which I am in therapy for...)

I also have to do weekly group hours at my site and they've been acting a little shady, so I'm concerned that this site might not be good... They automatically are making me do more hours than is required by my program, but I knew this from the start and was okay with it because I just wanted a site. However now they're trying to make me do even more hours, and my supervisor/boss dude also is saying things that don't add up. I received a welcome letter that detailed my exact responsibilities and requirements upon hire (I'll be here for both prac and internship) and now he's saying things that don't add up to what that letter said. I set a boundary with him and I need to decrease my hours back down to THEIR minimum amount because THEIR minimum is still above my school's requirements! This place in general seems a little off and like it doesn't have the best boundaries. And in my own mental health journey, setting boundaries with a person in a position of authority who I feel like I need to have a good relationship with is incredibly anxiety provoking. Also, he's a little too jokey with me...

Ugh. I'm venting. I'm looking for advice and support. I'm thankfully blessed to not have to work at this time, so I've got that going for me, but I'm doing all this clinical work and an additional class for school and with all of the imposter syndrome thoughts/anxiety about being a good clinician added to all this, its so much."

Welcome to the next Astro Practicum! I'm taking up the torch because I find these super helpful as a beginner.

Our chart this week -

* [Whole sign chart](https://imgur.com/a/ZNIRW2m)
* [Placidus chart](https://imgur.com/a/hReyFZS)

We will share a mystery celebrity chart with confirmed date and location (rated A-AA) and you can put your astrological skills to the test!

Please tell me:

1. What the native is known for
2. Native’s personality traits

Don't forget to include your basis for your guesses from the native's chart!

Whether you are beginner or advanced, please don’t be shy to participate and post your interpretation of the chart. We are here to learn. :) I will do my best to give feedback but please know that I am a beginner myself!

Winner will be announced at the end of the week and host next week’s practicum. Let’s get started!

Edit: The Astro Practicum 7 chart belongs to >!Amy Poehler! Here's a few points from her chart that I think are clearly seen in her persona and work:!<

>!Mars in the 1H conjunct the N Node and trine Uranus- Amy is certainly known for her fiery, driven disposition. She's well known for her quote, ""Great people do things before they're ready,"" which certainly has a Martian quality, in my mind. I also think of a great anecdote about her from I think Tina Fey's autobiography during their time together on SNL, talking about a moment where I think Jimmy Fallon made a joke about Amy getting him a sandwich or something (a friendly joke, I don't think Jimmy meant it seriously) but Tina describes Amy's eyes as bursting into flames and she gave him a quick, sharp dress down immediately on the spot. !<

>!Ruler of the AC in the 5H- creative pursuits being a focus of Amy's life and tied directly to her identity.!<

>!Ruler of the MC in the 1H- tying the native's personhood to what they are most known for, which I believe points to her career in performance art.!<

>!Moon in Leo- certainly a desire to be witnessed and observed, a certain performativity when it comes to processing emotions, again (for me) in clear relationship with her work as a performer.!<

>!Mercury exalted in Virgo- communication being an emphasis in the native's life (especially with her Sun there too), seen in her work in comedy as well as in writing.!<

>!I also find it interesting how many people thought the native was in politics/humanitarian efforts considering one of the things Amy is most well known for is her character on her show Parks and Recreation! I imagine Leslie Knope as a Sun in Virgo/Aquarius Rising with Mars in the 1H too. :)!<

I am having severe anxiety about everything; documentation, whether or not I am actually good at this; always feeling like I am going to mess something up or that I already have messed something up. I also have a slew of physical symptoms and difficulty sleeping because of it. It has gotten to the point that it is almost paralyzing and impacting my ability to get things done.

10g3hue,practicum,Got my practicum placement… would like advice,specialed,PoiisonMango,2023-01-19 14:46:48,3,"At my university for my major (exceptional needs mild interventions k-12) I have about 4 practicums to complete, as well as student teaching. Last year, I had my secondary practicum and this semester I’m taking my elementary practicum. One problem. My professor ran out of elementary placements, so I’m at a middle school (6-8).

Now in the future I actually want to be a high school resource teacher so I’m not too bothered, I don’t do well with kids below the age of about 10. I’m an only child and the youngest in my family. 

This will be my second practicum at a middle school and I feel like it’s all the more important to have that elementary experience if I know that I’m not experienced with young children, maybe I would end up liking it (I kind of doubt it but who knows). 

But I’m mostly worried because it’s only me and one other person in a middle school, and everyone else (about 20 others) are in elementary. I fear that I won’t really be able to take what I learn in class and apply it to my practicum correctly since it’s a different environment… plus I know that my cooperating teacher will be co-teaching and pushing into different subjects a lot. My professor told me to let my methods professor know I’m in middle school so we can adapt the lesson plans appropriately… 

I’m really bummed because at my last placement I was put into a more self-contained classroom at the middle school level while my friend who’s an intense major got put into a resource room… I feel like I keep getting the “different” experiences. I have 2 practicums to take next semester and I’m hoping they work out better…

Does anyone have any advice for me either regarding the situation or especially taking the info for elementary and adapting it to middle school? It’s a mixed grade classroom, youngest is 6th grade oldest is 8th. 

Tl;dr: my professor ran out of elementary practicum placements and put me in a middle school"

The majority of these fields are predominantly worked by women. The kicker is schools will usually make you pay to stay enrolled while you go work for free. Seems like a clever scheme made up in the past to get some free labour."

We will share a mystery celebrity chart (rated A-AA) and you use your astrology skills to delineate the native's chart. The winner will host next week's practicum!

[Our mystery celebrity!](https://imgur.com/a/RBAEbkT)

Please tell me:

1. What was the native known for? 

2.  What was his personal life like?

3. How would you describe his personality?

Please don't feel shy about participating, the goal is learning. :)

**Answer:**

>!Alan Turing!!<

>!The most points go to u/rectovrso, u/LOVEPEACEW33D, and u/2KatEyes for getting the tech + queer and/or scandal with relationships.!<

>!One thing that I didn't see brought up by anyone was the counter antiscia between Saturn and Uranus/MC, where Saturn is both the ruler of Aquarius 9th house to begin with, ruler of the 8th house, in the 12th house, and malefic out of sect (night chart). I think this spoke to the secrecy of a lot of his work and later the early death and suffering in his life.!<

>!That Saturn Uranus connection in his chart also I think made it a trigger point as he died (most likely suicide) when transiting Saturn in the Scorpio 6th house was at a square to his natal Uranus.!<

>!I had a hard time saying ""not on track"" to both financial and activism significations, as he now is a common figure championed for queer rights activism and recently put on the £50 note. A good example of the chart living on past the native's life. Honorable second place for u/Jonnuska, u/siren5474, u/EuphoricToe1.!<

>!Also in regards to his movie biopic The Imitation Game- it was criticized for the portrayal of his personality which most people here accurately called out. He was eccentric but by accounts a typical Gemini rising :). Benedict Cumberbatch who played him also shares some flavors of his chart- Libra rising w/ Pluto first house, Cancer sun with Mercury combust/under the beams, Uranus-Saturn aspect, and malefic out of sect in the 12th. I do recommend the movie though!!<"

ztph8d,practicum,Is this normal for internships and practicum?,therapists,CorazonLock,2022-12-23 18:46:47,7,"Wasn’t sure if I could post as an independent thread or need to write under the student mega thread. 

I’m in my last year of my masters program for clinical MH counseling. I was planning to start practicum in summer 2023. I currently work in child welfare at a contract agency that also has a therapy program. I was in contact with the therapist supervisor late this spring/early summer as I wanted to do my P/I there since I was already working there. We communicated a lot and they seemed very receptive and excited for me to have this opportunity as a solid employee in their CW program. 

In October, my school changed up programming and decided to only offer certain classes in certain semesters. It’s an online program. This would have put my grad date out farther, and I wasn’t about that, so my advisor agreed to let me do practicum in the spring. As soon as this was agreed to, I let my agency’s therapy supervisor know. I was also given an extension to turn in paperwork until Dec 15. 

There was one therapist that was going to do it for me in the agency but found she hadn’t had enough years of licensure. This was closer to the Nov 30 original application date, and at this time, I told my agency I had an extension for the paperwork. 

One week before the extension date, I got a call from the therapy supervisor telling me another therapist was willing to do it, but they’d have to compensate her for overseeing me, and therefore, they wanted me to sign a contract stating I would stay on for two years as a counselor after licensure. The supervisor made it all about money and how they “wanted to invest in me.” The contracts weren’t even drawn up yet, and the therapist who would oversee me hadn’t totally committed. The whole thing seemed like a red flag. They still haven’t sent out any contract to me. Fortunately, my school was understanding of the situation and gave me another deadline extension for Jan 5. 

I am now scrambling to find another opportunity. I’m really insulted by the fact that they didn’t decide this until last minute when I gave them more than timely notice I think. I have worked at the agency for almost 3 years now, and I get told over and over again what a good employee I am. They wouldn’t be paying me for my time doing the internship, and I think I got screwed over, which is hurtful considering what time I have put into my work. 

Is asking for a contract normal? Another agency asked that I at least consider working for them because of the large commitment it is to have an intern. To me, I think it’s bad enough you are not paid. But is this the norm now in this field? How am I supposed to commit to something if I don’t even know if I’ll align with their agency? I was also told no guarantees that I’d be hired. 

I am considering looking for different employment because it’s hard to fathom working at a place that has treated the situation so poorly, but there’s that doubt in my mind that I am overreacting. Feedback would be welcomed."

She said I'm not outspoken enough and kinda just let the kids do what they want as long as they're not being disruptive, following directions, and not hurting anyone. She said I need to be a lot more assertive and not let the kids boss me around type of thing.

I've always been a pretty laid-back person, but I will intervene if I see that kids are hurting each other or being disruptive, or not following directions. I've been thinking a lot about what she said and I feel that maybe I'm really not fit for this type of job, especially in such a high-stress environment and misbehaving kids.

I've been wanting to switch majors for around 2 years now, but keep putting it off because I kinda want to finish this degree at the same time before I suddenly decide to do something else and also because I don't really want to go through more school. I really do enjoy kids and I've been told I'm good with kids but I feel like I can't manage an entire classroom full of them, I can only handle a few of them at a time and I feel like I can't properly teach them.

I made a post here earlier last week about dealing with practicum after the death of my dad. I’m afraid things have gotten worse. My mentor teacher has not been the most understanding and after two days at practicum she implied that I may fail as she doesn’t think I can meet her expectations. 

I just wanted to ask any ATs/MTs on here if they ever failed a teacher candidate before and on what basis? I’m not sure what I did wrong as I’ve just been observing the first two days and haven’t taught yet. I just want to be prepared and avoid things that she may fail me for. 

I’ve honestly been in a constant state of panic and anxiety because of this and dealing with grief at the same time hasn’t been the best. I’ve talked to my practicum facilitator about the issue and asked to change schools but they basically just told me to stick it out till the end of practicum (end of December) and if I fail I’ll just have to do practicum again which isn’t ideal. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you all!

UPDATE: I should add that I have informed my mentor teacher that my father has passed. She was informed by my practicum facilitator prior to me starting and we also talked about it on my first day. I am completely transparent with what I am going through, which is why I’m even more surprised with the way she’s been acting."

The practicum site wants me to start next week but I may not start my practicum course the same week as I am waiting on some paperwork. I may end up registering late for the course. Am I still able to see clients although I am not in practicum yet officially?

Also, what would you guys consider some red flags at a practicum site? I was very eager to start this practicum site but now I am not so sure...

The director of the site wanted me to start away and didn't do an interview. Its a non-profit and she said they were in need of people. Their site was super old looking like 70s wallpaper and box VCR TV. Everything is being done with paper and no technology. Like paper billing, paper progress notes, etc. Also no one has their own office and there are just therapy rooms that is first come, first serve it seems like, is that normal?

The part that got me was that as an intern I would get a pair of keys to the building when I need to do my shifts if no one is already there. I wouldn't mind but the office is in a questionable area and she said there will be one day of my schedule where I will be the only person there. Is that normal? Should I be concern?

I am having a lot anxiety starting practicum and idk if its the site making uncomfortable or the nervousness of actually doing practicum.

Any insights would be appreciated!
--------------------‐---------------------------------------------------

Update: Emailed my school and they said no I cannot see clients if I am just starting Practicum, but I can see them if I was in between registering for Practicum as long as it doesn't exceed 90 days.

Also, I can not be left alone on site according to AAMFT code of ethics for supervisors' standard 4.4 and 4.59. Which would imply that trainees should not be left alone at a facility to see clients as this would mean assigning the trainee with the responsibility of being competent to see such clients.

What’s the best program to get my school hours from for graduation? How do I get the most hours while still working full time? Any advice or words of wisdom?"
yr3m19,practicum,No practicum reports to apply for jobs,CanadianTeachers,Honeymustard416,2022-11-10 03:04:45,7,"I became a certified teacher in 2015 but never applied to school boards because I naturally went into the autism field and have been working as a behaviour therapist. Now I’m interested in becoming a teacher but I noticed that I have to upload 2 practicum teaching reports. It never occurred to me to keep the reports as I didn’t know I would need them to apply for jobs. Am I screwed or what?

Does that mean I can never get a teaching job or is there a different way? 

I’ve asked my mentor teachers and they don’t have them saved as it was long ago and York university only keeps it on file for 1 year so it’s long gone. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks"
zpb2rj,practicum,Which senior practicum opportunity would be best for an aspiring ICU nurse?,StudentNurse,mntn_mermaid,2022-12-18 23:03:31,2,"There are two potential opportunities for my practicum in the ED, or the PCU. I know I want to end up in the ICU, so I feel as tho PCU might be better experience in the long run (am I wrong?) and I feel as though that experience would be directly applicable in the ICU. However I think ED might be fun to try, although I wonder if the skills I learn ED can be transferred to the ICU. Thoughts?

Welcome to the Astro Practicum, where someone of us will post a celebrity chart (since personal ones are not yet allowed) and ask the participating practitioners to answer few questions about the person. Whoever gives the most accurate answers, he will be the next person to post a chart in the Astro Practicum.

Hints can be given throughout the process when needed. To qualify for the Practicum, you always need to back up your statements astrologically. Explaining how you derived your answers. The whole idea of practicum is to learn astrology from each other and have fun sharing it openly. Those of you who don't like to do so, will be able to participate without option to post charts in the Practicum.

So without further due, let's kick this off with the celebrity chart I chose for our first Practicum, which you can find [here](https://imgur.com/s2zuyvB)

Those are the questions to be answered:

1. ​ What's the person career?
2. ​ What are they most known for?
3. ​ Three main characteristics best describing the personality?

Please have fun and don't forget this is not a competition. Good luck and let's start this Practicum :)

>!Chart Reveal: I'd like to thank everyone, who participated in the Astro Practicum and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. The chart belongs to Björk. :))!<

>!Answers: She is musician and best known for her voice. Eccentric, unique, emotional, passionate, otherworldly...!<

>!Astrological data: Moon and Sun in 1H Scorpio, as rulers of 9H/10H, shows she is very popular in her field, self-employed (10H) and unusual (Neptune on Asc). Moon + Neptune shows music and artistry in particular. Ruler of Rising Scorpio is Mars, exalted with Venus in 3H Capricorn. She is very vigorous, expressive, dynamic and passionate. Always on the move. Mars and Venus in 3H shows practical artistic inclination, mostly with hands. So she is trained musician, playing with her hands (3H). Ruler of 4H Aquarius is Saturn in 5H Pisces, showing her early education as musician. Venus as ruler of 7H/12H represent her love for collaborations and partnerships. Most of her music is done with close, trusted friends or partners. Saturn is in the exaltation sign of Venus, whereas Venus is with exalted Mars in Saturn domicile connected with sextile. Therefore Venus and Saturn have mutual reception, which realized her musical/artistic potential. Furthermore, ruler of her Virgo MC Marcury is in 2H of speech and voice in mutual reception with retro Jupiter in Gemini, coming out of his exalted Cancer position, which is in separated trine with her Moon. This signifies the connection between music and desire to sing. This also explains her strong communicative/writing abilities as a songwriter. The themes are emphasized by The Nodes in Sag-Gemini axis as well.!<"
z5dde5,practicum,Ghosted by practicum host after confirming?,CanadianTeachers,electradice,2022-11-26 17:48:51,8,"For my program, we have to arrange our own practicums. So I cold emailed a place and they responded very enthusiastically: “Very excited to pursue this with you, the gang can’t wait to meet you” etc. We exchanged several emails back and forth confirming date and details. 

But when I sent the host teacher a form they have to fill in in order to confirm with my program, they ghosted. I sent a follow up email after 2 weeks, and this is being ignored too. 

I understand I should look for another practicum at this point but I’m just wondering- anyone have any idea why this would happen? Is ghosting in the middle of arranging practicums common? 

(This is for a private school in Toronto ON)

EDIT: Everyone is saying I should try phoning the school before I give up since the email could have been overlooked, I think I’ll do that thank you!

As the title states, I’m currently doing my practicum in counselling psychology and am doing this at a school. I am the only counsellor at the school next to my supervisor who I meet with for an hour every week. 

My supervisor and I were going over my term review and the issue being brought up is me not “socializing” and interacting with colleagues more. She pushes me to be more active in school activities and hang out with staff and teachers however I am only there a couple days a week and my day is usually full with appointments. 

I didn’t realize my introversion was going to cause me problems in my practicum as I have no issues with clients or sessions. 

I also do not plan to be a school counsellor. 

I guess I’m just venting because I’m feeling a bit insecure about my introversion and focusing on my work. I don’t know, but it’s been causing a bit of anxiety."

I’ve been able to do online programs for school so far, which allows me to work a full-time job. However, it seems that almost every graduate program expects me to drop down to part-time work or just not work to complete their practicums.

Here’s the thing: I work full-time in a public school as a SpEd paraprofessional. Because I’m contracted, it’s not like I can “drop down” to part-time hours. I’m also the main income source of the household, so while becoming a substitute teacher temporarily is an option, I can’t live on that salary. Or any lack of benefits. Hell, I can barely afford to live where I am now. And I don’t want to get out of the school system, because I’m planning on taking a SLP job in the district when I graduate.

My idea is to use the resources at my disposal and the fact that we have an in-house SLP at our school and work with my principal to either have a time of day where I shadow her for the hours, or go to another school she services with her and shadow her. Has anyone ever successfully done something like this? Or knows of a program more lenient towards this sort of thing? I’m not trying to get out of the work, I’ll do the required time and everything, I just can’t afford to quit my job.

Any suggestions?"

Does this area feel safe to live in? I have read some old posts saying to avoid it, but some newer ones suggest it is fine.

I am asking because she has bad anxiety and I want to know if this neighborhood feels safe to walk through as a woman.

How do I go about recording classes for them to observe when I'm a teaching assistant and not the main teacher? My concern is I start the program, but am unable to finish it because of the practicum.

Eyeing the position of Key account manager, should I pursue an MBA or get another bachelor's degree?

MBA:

Pros:

2 years only. Both De La Salle University and Ateneo de Manila University accept students without business undergraduate degree.

Cons:

I do not see an internship/practicum program in both school's MBA syllabus.

Worried that all I would learn are theories. What's important to me is training and practical application.

Bachelor’s (BSBM) :

Pros:

With Internship program. Theories and practical application.

Cons:

Takes 4 years. Too many subjects to take that I don't even need."

Winner will be announced at the end of the week and host next week’s practicum. Let’s get started!

**24.11.22 (AEDT) - CHART REVEAL BELOW:** 

The winner of the practicum this week is u/minnie_van_driver.

>!The native is: the late, great High Priestess of Soul - the brilliant and complex Ms Nina Simone!<

>!A couple of biographical articles that shed light on her life for those unfamiliar: !<

* >!https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice!<
* >!https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/04/nina-simone-biography-old-hollywood-book-club!<

>!In hindsight this was probably a pretty difficult chart to interpret as there is nothing immediately obvious from it that points clearly and directly to what native was known for perhaps - sorry about that. However:!<

* >!Capricorn Moon in 12th ruled by Saturn in Aquarius conj AC in 1st - Simone's mother (Moon) was main breadwinner for family when she was a child, her mother was an religious minister and preacher (12th house Capricorn,) Nina began her musical career as a child playing piano in her mothers' church without any prior formal training when she was still very young (Aquarius AC and Venus in 1st - she was unusual, stood out for her artistic talent.) Mother noticed Nina's obvious talent and sent her for lessons. In time their entire community crowdfunded Nina's ongoing music lessons and education. Nina was denied a scholarship to a prestigious music school due to racism (Saturn conj. AC.) !<
* >!I'm surprised no-one mentioned the gigantic Cardinal T-Square in this chart - Moon in Capricorn  12th house, Pluto in Cancer 6th house, Uranus in Aries 3rd house. Mental health (6th/12th axis) played a huge role in Simone's life and art (she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder later in life,) as did abuse. She was capable of erratic and unpredictable behaviour at times (Uranus/Pluto/Moon) as well as being a victim of violence both personally (husband Andrew Stroud was physically and emotionally abusive) and on a wider level as a member of oppressed minority during Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s when she was at peak of career - she wrote/performed generationally defining songs (Uranus/ Pluto) about these experiences (""Mississippi Goddam,"" ""Four Women,"" ""I Wish I Knew What it Felt Like to Be Free,"" ""Young, Gifted and Black"" etc.)!<
* >!Mars/Jupiter/Neptune Rx conj. in 7th in Virgo opposite Mercury in Pisces in 1st - I am really interested in Rx planets in natal chart and how they express themselves having a Venus Rx natally myself. I feel that these planets are even more prominent in Simone's chart given their strong opposition to Mercury and with Mars Rx as ruler of her Scorpio MC. The strong opposition between Mars/Mercury to me implicates both planets in native's career (MC) - so we could say from this that personal expression and communication (Mercury) were strong career themes. Rx planets express themselves differently and a bit eccentrically compared to direct planets in natal charts I believe - Simone was definitely unusual, eccentric, brilliant and unafraid to stand up for herself and her beliefs even if it meant being criticised, alienated or shunned - also speaks to her Aquarius AC, Venus and Saturn as well. Heavy Pisces/Virgo shows up in a lot of artistic peoples' charts I feel - the Mars/Jupiter/Neptune conj in her 7th speaks to many of her material, career and public rewards and recognition (Mars/Jupiter as rulers of her 2nd, 10th, 11th houses and her Pisces Sun/Mercury in intercepted 1st house) coming from her relationships with others (7th house) - in many ways this is true of her as benefitting from the guidance and support of family, teachers and community early in life as well as her own incredible tenacity and work ethic (Capricorn Moon, Saturn 1st house.) !<

**Answer below**

>! The mystery chart belongs to Meghan Markle, wife of Prince Harry. !<

>! Previously, she was a model and an actress. She is most known for her marriage to Prince Harry and their exit (dubbed Megxit) from the family after only a few years, with mental health struggle and their children’s privacy issue as the main reason (Mars in Cancer, Moon opp MC).!<

>!Ever since her exit from the royal family, she’s been taking it up to media and speak up about her feelings (Moon 3H) which are causing a lot of scandals and rumors. She is also known to be very secretive and protective with her children. Prior to her exit from the royal family, there was an ongoing feud with her father that goes public (Saturn opp MC) and also her sister. !<

>!Mars is definitely hard for her. Squaring Jupiter, she can be hasty and her own worst enemy. Squaring her moon, she can be quick tempered and intolerant, as reported lately in the media. Her life story is an ongoing one, but it has been plagued with scandals/rumors/miscommunication lately and almost everything always related to her family somehow, in line with her 12H Cancer theme.!<

>!So congratulations to u/stodolaa , u/Curious-Can4908 and u/Tudlod ! You are this week’s winner for scoring the most points! Do let me know which one of you would like to host the next practicum. !<

>!Thank you again everyone for your participation! I know this chart is not easy but I learnt a lot from the way you guys read the chart too!!<"

Either they have no one to supervise or they lose paperwork. Now they held paperwork and turned it in to where she would miss the deadline. Now she's having to start the paperwork all over again. What options does she have to be able to get this going so she can finish her practicum? This has been mentally and emotionally damaging for her on top of a lot of stuff already having been happening for the past few years. I'm watching her breakdown and fall to pieces, even being in therapy for around 4 or 5 years.

What can she do to force this process through? Are there boards or legal entities we can involve to secure her educational path or is she at the mercy of these people that want to play with her educational path and her health?

Any help would be appreciated.

Also didn’t get cards or crafts from students at the school. I’m disappointed. I’m not angry or upset…just bummed. 

The dynamics between my supervisor was kinda different from my previous supervisor over the summer. I mean they were nice and helped me out and did everything a mentor is supposed to do to help their interns develop/grow.. all that good stuff. I liked the site, built rapport with clients, and I did very well on my evaluations. 

Seeing my classmates posting what they got from their supervisors and kids from their school placements kinda makes me feel bad, sad, and left out. Kinda like I wasn’t special or something. I got hugs from kids, so I remind myself that’s a gift in itself. I love hugs 💞

Is it okay that I feel disappointed? I feel odd for asking this. 

I know your supervisors are not obligated to give you anything. I don’t expect anything at the end, but I guess getting a gift makes me feel good.. like I feel valued and appreciated. I like giving stuff to people, I get warm fuzzy feelings preparing something and giving it to them lol..Maybe that’s one of my love languages I wasn’t aware that I had.

I experience none of this while I'm here. Also being removed from the environment I use in does wonders for me.

yu3qw3,practicum,Advice for first practicum block?,CanadianTeachers,Technical_Flounder50,2022-11-13 14:48:56,8,"Hey everyone,

I’m in my first year of a 2-year b.Ed after-degree program, and next week marks the beginning of my first ever 3.5 practicum block where I will be teaching 30% of the days. 

While a lot of the other student teachers tell me how excited they are and seem so confident, I’m terrified. So far my practicum experience (to this point once per week while in class, largely observational) has been… messy. My co-operating teacher was super talented, but constantly getting pulled out of the classroom on the days she was there, and wasn’t there at all quite a few of my days leaving me with a sub - so I haven’t exactly observed a ton of teaching. 

There was one day, in the first couple days I was there, where I got an email from her at 5am saying she had an emergency and wasn’t coming in and the school couldn’t find a sub, so I had to sub for her class all day. It went okay and I was able to manage the classroom, but suffice to say my whole experience has just been very chaotic. 

Then, last week she took a resource position at a different school and left. I now have a new CT who I haven’t met. 

I’m going to be teaching grade 6 science as an english/social studies student, so my confidence is already feeling pretty shakey as science is not my strong suit. This whole situation has made me so anxious because I have no relationship with my new co-operating teacher and she will be the one evaluating me. The students are feeling very disregulated since the transition of teachers, and management has been a huge challenge. 

When I talk to the other student teachers who tell me how smooth their practicum is and how helpful their CT’s have been, I feel so jealous. I’m doing the best I can and my new CT sounds nice over email, but I can’t shake the nerves. I’m worried that if I’m this nervous now, I’m not cut out to be in this profession. 

Does anyone have any advice that could calm my nerves at all going into my first block? I love the kids, just this whole experience and the lead up to it has really shaken me. 

Thank you :)"

Why I am posting here: I believe all bodies deserve care and I am a body neutral, LGBTQ+ safe space provider. Historically healthcare can be weight centric and I love working with people on goals in order to break out of that paradigm!

* I am a Registered Nurse in the USA who is seeking practicum clients for 4 tele-health sessions (usually about 20-60 minutes each).
* Sessions are free as I am a student and you are gifting me your time.
* I am licensed in 34 States and jurisdictions.
* We typically will meet weekly or every other week by Google Meet.
* In sessions I can help you work on diving into the who/what/when/where/why of what your care needs are and help you create goals that meet you where you are in your life.

I'm also going to be hosting a small group coaching course for body neutral support just after the new year if anyone is interested in joining. The small group would meet for 2-4 sessions between the new year and January 22nd.

Thank you to the admins for the one time posting exception!

1009qy7,practicum,Question about Practicums and Admissions,premedcanada,RatPumpkin,2023-01-01 02:24:04,1,"Hello 

The chance I would ever get into med is incredibly small but, I have a question about my program as I keep seeing wording in the eligibility to apply that makes me think my program would be overlooked?

I have a 1st Bachelor with a low GPA, I am currently getting a second bachelor that is going much better (Currently have all 4.0s in my second bachelor and hoping to keep this going! I didn't start it to get into med its just how my school does this specific program.) The second bachelor however only takes 3 semesters, each semester I have 4 courses, 3 which are for grade and weighed at 0.5 credit, and 1 which is a practicum which is credit or no credit, but this practicum is weighted as 1 full credit. 

So while I technically am carrying a full course load, I will only have 3 grades, and 1 credit/no credit that is weighted for 1 whole credit. On top of that I will have a full semester in the spring. Does this basically mean this new bachelor and the year will be overlooked by places like Ottawa (1 pass/fail course max per sem, need to have full time study ) or, Western ( Max 1 full pass/fail per year) or cause me issues at any other med schools if I were to apply?

Thanks for the help! Good luck everyone!"

I'm weighing my options and wondering if anyone has completed the data analytics bootcamp offered by Practicum? 

As a novice in the field I'm not quite ready to dive into data science, but I'd like a structured program that teaches both theory and technical skill for analytics. Practicum seems to cover the essentials- Sheets, SQL, Python, Tableau, and an intro to ML.

I'm also considering the Google Data Analytics Certificate... but judging by recent posts this doesn't seem like the best way to acquire technical skills. 

A little about me- I ultimately would like to do healthcare data analytics/ possibly a health informatics masters degree in the future. I currently work in clinical research, but not in a data role. I completed a week-long bootcamp in R about 2 months ago and got really excited about the field of data after that.

This centre is extremely understaffed and I swtg they are using student teachers for labour or something. I am exhausted and burnt out. 

I have an Associate Teacher (AT) who is supposed to be guiding me but I don't feel like I'm learning anything at all because I am constantly being told to ""help"" and by ""help"" they mean ""clean"" or to fetch things for them. I am happy to clean and help out, in fact, I do it when no one asks me to... But my problem is that I do the bulk of it. I've done more cleaning here as a ST than my job as a reliever at another daycare. 

Once I was even told to go next door to help 'cause they didn't have enough teachers (hello, I'm a student... I'm not part of the ratio???? ). Half the time, they're not even in ratio. On days where they are in ratio, it never lasts long cause one will be called to sub for another age group or one will go out for lunch etc. 

Another teacher (who is NOT my AT) thinks it's okay to boss me around and I am so sick of it. 

I completely understand that as a student teacher, I'm a guest, so I've kept my mouth shut and tried to just do what I can... I love love love the children so much (and the parents are so lovely) but I honestly can't take it anymore. 

Will definitely be reporting this to my university but I'm a bit worried about what might happen. Just really sad my last practicum turned out this way, my previous practicums were great, so I know this isn't normal. 

Anybody else been in the same position before? What did you do?

It just overall drains my energy having to deal with them and the amount of activity that goes on with them/how hyper they all are. I don't even think I'll be able to last another 7-8 months of this without going crazy.

I  have two clinical internship possibilities right now for my 2nd-year  (final) MSW practicum and am weighing my options. Any advice? Below is a  list of areas in which they differ, with bolded bits indicating what I  really like about each option and italics showing what I strongly  dislike (and neither if it's not strong either way). If I count each  distinct positive as +1 and each distinct negative as -1, both options  are equal.

|Option 1|Option 2|
|:-|:-|
|**My exact population of interest**|Non-specialized (might include my population of interest, but it also might not)|
|Hours split across more days (e.g. 4 hrs/day) - *I use the bus so this is more commute time*|**Consolidated hours (e.g. 7 hrs/day) - I use the bus so this is less commute time**|
|Mostly **interactive shadowing, with me taking a small, closely supervised caseload** *near the middle of my 2nd of the two semesters.*|Brief shadowing for 1-2 weeks followed by me **having my own rotating caseload** for 2-6 sessions per client|
|**Longer-term clients & treatment modalities**|Shorter-term clients and brief treatment modalities|
|Supervisor is not a social worker (but **has extensive experience and a 20+ year career**); therefore, *I'd have additional MSW supervision from my university to meet CWSE requirements*|Supervisor meets CSWE and school supervision requirements - **no additional supervision necessary**|
|More stringent scheduling|**I dictate my own hours**|
|**This agency feels like a strong fit, personality-wise**|This agency feels so-so personality-wise|
|Unpaid. **If I have my own caseload, those clients will be free or nominal fee (e.g. $10 per session).**|Unpaid. *I  will only see clients who self-pay starting at what I find an excessive fee for an intern (the equivalent to insurance reimbursements for LMSWs  in my area) and EAP clients.* |

For context, I don't already have much clinical experience (my first internship is not clinical), although I do feel reasonably comfortable in clinical settings and have slightly above average knowledge (compared other MSW students in my program) of the primary treatment modalities used at both agencies."

My program requires students to do two practicums over the course of 6 months. The first practicum we need to meet with individual clients, and the second practicum includes 10 hours with groups which can include families and couples. 

The difference between our practicum and internship requirements is that during practicum we are only to see 1-3 clients per week for the first practicum, and don't take a larger caseload than what an internship may have. Hopefully that all makes sense."

It could be that I'm at what's labeled an ""inner city"" school, and as someone who had a gifted designation and was put in strong enrichment programs throughout school, it's hard to teach when basic skills are lacking.

My major issues are that 1) the kids don't seem to care about the material. I'm bringing out good stuff, my mentors say they're engaged and that I'm teaching really well, but there's a general air of stress/depression/disconnect with the kids. It makes me feel like what I'm teaching is irrelevant nonsense to help them pass high school. Getting engagement and interaction is like pulling teeth. I am so passionate about my subject and I'm trying to spread that to the kids... but in high school I was pretty much past caring, so it doesn't surprise me that they are too. I love a good challenge, and I always have, especially an intellectual one, but this doesn't feel like a challenge, it feels like a dead end. 

As well, my teacher is less knowledgeable in the subject than I am. She's more of a coach/classroom manager than an actual content teacher. Which is fine and definitely useful, but the kids in her classes are *not* learning. Her teaching style is totally different than mine so we aren't really connecting, and she also seems more preoccupied with admin stuff and interpersonal staff drama. That's not to say she doesn't care about the kids cause she absolutely does, but it's off-putting.

Have i chosen the wrong career? Is it like this everywhere? I was feeling so excited and stimulated about practicum and now halfway through I'm totally discouraged."

But my school (ABSN program) does not allow students to request where they want to work for their final practicum. Regardless of interest, experience or grades. Most get put on a night shift Med Surg floor. 

We also do not get to go experience the ED, ICU or any other floor other then Med Surg or OB/LD during our program.  

I believe that letting students choose will accelerate their careers.  I do think the staff should be able to say “no” to someone who may not be cut out for that unit (we all know a few of those). But for the majority it hinders experience."

I’m a second year MFT student and had a difficult moment when I was a student therapist during practicum recently. Our client was in crisis and in tears because she was hungry and was denied food stamps. She recently started a minimum wage job and now makes too much money to qualify for certain public assistance programs but is struggling to make ends meet. 

My team all gathered/brainstormed resources she could utilize during the session (food banks, local charities, etc.), but I was at a loss for what to say afterward. The typical questions I would ask someone during a session wouldn’t have been appropriate in this context. A third year student and our supervisor jumped in with a grounding exercise and carried the remainder of the session for the most part because the other student therapist (also a 2nd year) and I were clearly struggling.

I wanted to ask some of the seasoned therapists on here what you do when a client’s problem involves not having access to basic life necessities. Any advice would be appreciated!"

It is explained to the students as an opportunity to see what it’s like being in the other chair, to notice what works for you and what doesn’t, and also if necessary to help you get by when you’re getting your feet wet in this field. The agency doesn’t request any information and either reimbursed the student or pays the fee directly depending on the student’s comfort level. (Some students actually stick with those therapists longer term so they keep the agency more at a distance.)

This year, one student just never got around to doing the session. They were reminded of it 3 or 4 times over 6 months, always waved it off as if they’d get to it, and never did. Apart from some other similar issues with this student (forgetting to follow through on tasks), I’m just curious how other professionals view this task and if it’s reasonable. 

And if so, how would you address the student that didn’t complete the session?"

My supervisor publicly humiliated me by comparing how awful my outfit is to a colleague *in the hallway.* (The point she was trying to make was dress code expectations, my issue was how she shamed me in front of others instead of just talking to me about it). Everything I say is wrong, I cannot get a word out of my mouth without her interrupting me or criticizing my word choice. **She isn't even a social worker.** I don't get to go to forensic nurse exams anymore, I don't see clients, I don't do anything that *matters*. And yet I still do everything wrong. When I say I have not heard anything positive come out of her mouth, I'm not kidding. Only what I screw up. And some of it is valid, but I just feel broken, like I'll never be a good social worker. I have cried (privately) multiple times, I feel like a screw-up, and it's horrible. I cry before going in everyday. My field professor knows I'm having challenges but I don't know what to do because I'm scared my supervisor will retaliate against me/tank my evaluations if she thinks I'm complaining about her.

Well 1st let's start off with literally did not introduce me to nobody I don't know their names I don't even think they know my name they weren't even like greeting me by my name they were basically just talking at me and I had to tell one of the girls she's like you can feed the baby and I was like are you talking to me and she's like yeah and I was like well my name is Gabby and then she likes sabotage me she left the baby's bottle unscrewed so when I went to go feed the baby it felt all over the baby and it's like she didn't even care she didn't try to change them nothing like that and plus she had the window open I live in Wisconsin its 54 degrees outside so you got a baby with the wet clothes and the windows open wondering why these boogers are everywhere and then 2nd they are talking about oh she (another worker)  voted for Donald Trump and they didn't even know the abortion law like??? Wjy atr you bringing up poltitics in a child care facility then when I was leaving they were talking about all let's play some multi cultural music the lady looked at the only baby of color and said do you want some multicultural music cause apperapntly we know nothing about it. Mind toy this was my first day. When I would go to area where there was a couple kids and they just left me with them while they went and talked by the food. Oh and they were swearing saying shit, pissed, damn. I don't want to be there but like I'm atta6to those kids they absolutely love me.

I’m about to start my practicum/internship in a couple weeks at an elementary school (K-8) here in Chicago. I’m super excited but also so nervous about what to expect. I’ve been working as a SECA for the past two years with CPS so I’m comfortable in a school setting, but walking into a completely new school in a new role has my nerves a little rattled. 
I was wondering if anyone had any tips or suggestions about things they wish they would have asked/done during their internship, or anything they prepared that was super helpful. Or just any words of encouragement would be great too! Thanks so much, I’m excited to be a part of this community!"
y2e4oz,practicum,I failed my teaching practicum out of my program and I want to end it all,offmychest,FriedForLifeNow,2022-10-12 20:12:11,3,"  I went to the dentist for emergency procedure and could not get my lesson plan in time for the associate teacher. I was kicked out the practicum and the program as a result. I travelled far from my home, 2 hours away, in order to get the job with the promise I would help my family with the mortgage. My father is sick from cancer and in mass debt from 20k in taxes over the years, my mother is only a hairdresser.   
   I get nothing from my parents nor any bursary. In fact, I have to live by myself and pay them as well. I was a full time student and work 35 hours a week. I was supposed to get 10k from the practicum and the bonus from my job for being a student. Now we could lose the home and I need the money by May.    
  If they know, I will be cut off from them and in turn have no way to hang out with my friends from my hometown. I know no one and have no life outside of school or work in the city I am in.  


I have loss everything no future left, I should just end it."

The dress code is business casual, and there’s the type of office chit chat that doesn’t come easily to me. How many times and ways can you say hello to someone? I feel anxious and just want to hide all day. I have trouble initiating conversations with my supervisor, and don’t feel confident when speaking to the other counselors. 
I’m more used to working directly with people. Some previous experience has been volunteering at a crisis line, supporting differently abled individuals one on one, and working with people with serious and life-threatening illnesses. I feel confident doing the actual work, but have always struggled with social anxiety and getting administrative tasks done. Now, I’m coming off as less capable than I am in the workplace. I need to have a conversation with my supervisor today but am sitting in my office too nervous to do so! Any advice on how to adapt to a professional environment and be more confident speaking to my supervisor?"

10eggb5,metis,Me meti a un plan de ahorro porque gano en dolares pero...,ArAutos,ProgramadorConGuita,2023-01-17 16:29:22,11,"Buenas, queria contar mi situacion con plan de ahorro a ver que opinan Volkswagen Taos

Me meti al plan en noviembre 2022 por una taos modelo base, el plan es 60% financiado en 84 cuotas, y el 40% ponerlo el dia de adjudicacion.

Mi intencion hasta ayer, era pagar el 40% por adelantado, ir adelantando 7 cuotas durante 8 meses (56 cuotas) hasta que me tocara la adjudicacion, y hacer el cambio de modelo a la taos highline (unos 10mil dolares mas).

recien hace unos dias pague mi 2da cuota, y resulta que llamé a administracion

## Vicente Zingaro e Hijos S.A calle 13 525.

&#x200B;

y me dicen ""No aceptamos dolares, ni transferencia ni efectivo ni nada, le damos un cupon y vaya al banco provincia con 4 millones en efectivo (40%) y adelanta su 40% ""

Claramente esto no fue lo que me dijeron al meterme al plan, me dijeron que yo podia ir a la concecionaria y pagar con dolares en efectivo y que no habia problema, que yo podia ir con mis 10mil dolares a pagar el 40%, y que podia ir con 800 dolares, y adelantar las cuotas que yo quisiera.

(CLARAMENTE no voy a pagar por banco esa cantidad de dinero, porque aqui todos sabemos que no le debemos al estado un 40% de nuestro sueldo contractor para los entendidos. Afip things cof cof)

Estoy por salirme del plan porque vi que hay muchas cosas negativas del plan, porque no pienso ir a un rapipago ni a un banco con 4 millones de pesos en efectivo... apenas llevo 500 dolares invertidos , en la primera cuota inscripcion y segunda cuota.

&#x200B;

Cual es la manera mas rapida de darse de baja ? tengo que mandar carta documento? ir putearlos un rato y salirme? dejar de pagar? como seria?

Pd: ya se que me devuelven la plata dentro de 84 meses, pero prefiero perder esos 500 dolares, que perder el resto si algo sale mal mas adelante.

pd2: creo que optaré por comprar un auto de contado usado.

&#x200B;

PD3: chicos perdon por no aclararlo no me metan hacha tanto, tengo un contador, tengo monotributo, tengo declaraciones de ahorros, tengo contabilidad creativa desde hace un rato...tengo como justificar cierta cantidad de dinero. Aclaro porque casi me quieren matar en los comentarios xD no se enojen tanto

In other words, what information could we send that the listening alien civilization may find useful? 

Some thoughts...  


* Mass of the Higgs boson
* Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem
* Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture
* Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D minor
* A warning that tetraethyl lead is poisonous to life based on organic chemistry

With any scientific or mathematical discovery, there's the risk that any civilization advanced enough to receive and understand the message would either already know it or be on the verge of discovering it themselves, so is there any piece of human knowledge that we may have lucked into ahead of our time?"

The arrows that felled their commanders were not hers.  Yet as she walked towards the slowly dissolving bodies her eyes locked eyes with the large green skinned brute shouting his junior officers into line.

""These lands are not yours."" Her voice never rose as she spoke. Though a being of water, her face held the vague shape where human features would be. Her gaze never wavered as the army stood there, staring at the spot where their leaders had been and now she stood. ""Around, or retreat. I am Metis. I care not which you choose.""

Another arrow flew. The ogre that took command raised a thick slab of metal that was its shield, and paused at the loud bell-like tone as arrow embedded itself. His stance firmed, eyes locked onto the water being as he took a step forward.

""The way is Shut."" As Metis spoke the surface of her body rippled and shimmered in time with her words. Her stance widened as she faced down the army in front of her, a clear challenge for them to go through, rather than around, her.

The ogre took another step forward, challenging her to stop him.

Metis launched herself into the head of the column. Most of their attacks passed through harmlessly. One slender Orc tried to reach into her body, to grab at the bauble suspended just behind where her sternum would have been. His reward was the water itself hardening around his hand as Metis reached behind her, shoving her fingers through his eye sockets. Moments later, a pair of hair fine water jets exiting the back of his skull

As the orc's body fell it shrived up, desiccating into a withered husk just before turning to powder. Metis pulled back, again standing before the army. ""The Way is Shut.

The ogre snarled, slamming a large studded club against the slab metal shield it held. This was not mindless posturing. Instead there was a pattern. In response, the formation rippled as creatures shuffled about. Orc shamen advanced through the line. Metis was magic in nature so they were going to use magic to clear the problem.

Metis stood there, the orb beneath her chest glowing faintly. Part of her wanted to continue the fight right now, press her advantage and keep her enemy from finding their feet. For Metis, the clock was also ticking.

At the same time, this way would prove more effective. Shamen, orc festooned with bone trinkets and ritualistically body scarring, advanced.

Metis took a step forward as their shamen began chanting. She could feel lines of power extending from them into the ground. She could feel those lines try wrapping around her body and fizzling once they contacted the water that surrounded the softly pulsing stone in her chest.

She would see their efforts redouble as she slowly advanced on them. More attempts to ensnare. More attempts to drain. All attempts fizzled when they connected with her body, producing little more than a soft ripple of steam on impact.

Her left arm raised, and she pointed to the Shaman at the front of this group. Her finger lengthened, the form of her hand smoothing and rippling until her arm was a whip wrapped around the orc's throat that did not let go until the desiccated husk hit the ground.

When she looked to the Ogre in charge of the army. She pointed to him, and spoke. ""The Way is Shut.""

The Ogre took a step back. Then another. Collectively, slowly, and fitfully, army fell back choosing to go around the parkland instead of through.

As they disappeared from sight, Metis walked to the decorative pond at the center of the park. As she stepped into the water, her body's features melted as it returned to the water that it had been formed from. The softly pulsing gemstone at her heart fell into the waiting maw of a frog the size of a small dog.

'Thank you Reaper.' Her voice calm as the frog swam with the stone in its maw. 'We have bought ourselves time. Hopefully enough to meet with whomever our archer friend is, and if my judgment is correct on the whom, it is my sincere hope he is willing to talk.'

The frog said nothing as it swam to the far shore.

'At the very least,' She mused, 'he must see that for the moment we need each other.'

Again, the frog said nothing, continuing to swim towards their holdings closest to The Toymaker's domain.

⁂ ⁂ ⁂

Taru saw the water creature stand in the army's way. She saw their leader, one of the creatures that had trespassed on the Library's grounds reach for his weapon. There had been no thought or hesitation when she let the first arrow fly. That should have caused the army to scatter, to find cover, and to send scouts to sniff out her position.

Instead the two subordinates reach for their weapons, bellowing orders, though she couldn't tell if it was at the water creature, or at their own troops. There was a moment of cruel humor as she let arrows fly. If they were so stupid that they would just stand around, she would educate them on why that was a bad idea.

Two more down. Then two more. Arguing amongst themselves. She grinned. Then two more met their end.

""Child."" She shuddered. Gears and wire wirring as her attention focused on the Doctor as he stood close to her just to one side of the window she was firing from. He would not speak unless it were important.

The orb he carried pulsed soft white light in time and intensity to his words. ""The Kobold you sought have been found at the edge of the parkland. As you have requested, contact has been kept at a minimum save for Marie.""

""Have they anything to say?"" Taru refocused. Gears and cogs tightening springs and cabling as she lined up another shot, this one to take down the large Ogre shouting orders to try reestablishing order.

She swore under her breath when the creature got its shield up in time.

""Such language,"" The Doctor gently chided, ""Does not suit someone as delicate as you.""

Taru couldn't afford to spare attention as the water creature was attacked from several corners. More arrows flew, hopefully unnoticed in the commotion, towards the troop formation's middle. These held no particular targets other than that she wanted to break unit cohesion and draw attention rearward.

The Doctor then approached, putting spyglass to eye. His wide painted grin lit to full as he watched. ""Curious. Inspired even. Using its body to ground out the hostile magics is utterly brilliant, but how?""

""I'd seen Ami pull that trick once. open a fire plug at a shield raised to keep us out."" Taru's voice soft as she watched the army scatter and fall back.

""Yes yes,"" The Doctor's grin un-lit as his annoyance seeped through, ""But how is it managing to keep personal cohesion? Typically all you have to do to break an elemental is break the surface tension keeping its form together, unless-"" He did not finish that sentence. Instead watching as the water creature entered the water.

""Can."" Taru started. ""Can a core do that? Use its land as a way to directly interact with things?""

This drew a good natured chuckle from the Doctor, ""Obviously yes, but I haven't the faintest idea on the how.""

The golem holding the clear orb gave a helpless shrug, showcasing how he had cheated the problem was more straightforward, ""I suggest you go meet with the kobold and say hello while I focus on evacuation.""

A nod from the clockwork automaton. She looked t othe Doctor. ""I will be back to fetch you.""

""Worry not for me,"" The Doctor reached out to touch her arm with a black clad mechanical hand. ""I shall endure, at least for a time. Go now.""

The two exchanged looks before Taru leapt from the window, intent on where she had to be rather than the troubles on her mind.

⁂ ⁂ ⁂

Raiph turned at the sound even as Leo talked to the diminutive marionette doll that had stepped from cover to get their attention. Sure, all this talk on evacuation, and armies, and respawning forces were well and good and important, but it left him bored.

Which is why he was the first to see Taru approach. ""Thought you were doing over-watch archer things. What's up?""

Only when the other three had turned their attention to her did the automaton speak. ""The army is falling back both because of my efforts, and because of a water creature that held their attention.""

""What's the bad news?"" Mikey was to the point as he inspected the bladed part of his chain weapon.

""They're dividing and going around to either side."" Taru's voice was neutral as she delivered the news. ""There is a chance that forces flanking the parkland can and will provide aid, but we can count on nothing but the time taken to fall back and fragment their forces.""

Leo would nod, ""So we're going down the middle to see who's water sprite that is?""

Though she lacked facial features Taru practically beamed at the lead kobold. ""Exactly.""

Then without another word she started towards the parkland as the four kobold brothers flanked her two on each side.

As the quintet stepped off the road onto the park itself they could feel a pressure wash over them. The four Kobold had weapons out. Taru raised a hand to motion them to put them away. ""Whoever is in charge of this place knows we are here. We are trying to talk peace. Weapons drawn will suggest we want a fight.""

""Easy for you to say,"" Raiph groused. ""You're the mythic hoodoo lady that's got a magical eraser bow.""

""Actually,"" A vaguely feminine appearing being stepped into view, ""It offered a symbolic link to the black heart of the galaxy. I do not know how such a link would have remained. Maybe it is only the world remade rather than the whole of creation after all.""

Taru's head tilted at the being made of water, obsidian eyes focusing on the grapefruit sized orb embedded in the water being's chest. ""How do you know this?""

The automaton's head tilted, gears and wheels spun, servos and pistons whined as she looked at the newcomer.

""I am Metis."" The water being stated simply. ""As for how I knew. It is simple for one who has seen your work Sagittarius.""

Light shone behind obsidian eyes and Taru reached for Metis. ""Aquarius."" There was a pause, a whine of piston. ""I'd heard you were free.""

""My core is clear for all to see."" Metis said simply. ""I have seen the threat that is coming and will do as I can to help.""

Dion slowly approached Metis, a clawed finger reaching out, stopping just before making contact. ""The amount of mana needed to animate that much water must be tremendous. I. How?"" He sputtered.

Metis eyed the Kobold. When she spoke her form practically danced with the ripples formed, ""It is both a topic I would find deep enjoyment in discussing, and something we haven't the time nor space for aside from it is something I cannot long maintain outside my holdings and even within for not much longer."" She would gesture about, ""Or in case you have forgotten. Armies. Marching.""

That reproach caused Dion's shoulders to slump. ""Fair,"" Though there was a hurt tone to his voice he stood at his place. ""The four of us are good for hit and fade assaults. How good a look at their forces did you have?""

""That is the wrong question,"" Metis stated. ""Any assault on the army is simply delaying them. As they are an army that can regenerate its troops, that is our priority as I see it.""

From far away they heard horns. One to the left, then answered by the one to the right. Metis flinched at the noise, ""They're regrouping faster than I had thought.""

Taru nodded before looking to the kobold. ""Do what you can. Anything to stall and disrupt with as little risk or energy spent.""

Four nods and they scattered. Leaving taru and Metis to look at each other.

""There is too much land between here and him for an alliance to sustain me in a fight."" Metis's voice was firm.

A large frog with leathery skin hopped close to Metis.

Taru looked to her. ""Do not ask. Please.""

""He'll kill himself trying to save me if he knows,"" Was her reply.

The two women walked side by side until the water holding Metis lost its form and her core swallowed by the frog, leaving Taru alone as a third horn sounded. This one from directly ahead.

A/N: This went from a chapter I felt had nothing to offer, to one that I feel moves things along quite nicely without having the problem of 'everyone sitting around in a coffee shop talking.'

Feel free to call me out if I ever start getting horrible about that. it's a trope i HATE, especially in comics.

Edit: I'm now on [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/63641/dungeon-corps) for those that wish to read there. The entirety of the kronos arc is up as well as the start to Expansion. I've been setting the rest of the ongoing arc to release once a week two chapters at a time to give myself some breathing space."

[(our verification post on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/metisdao/status/1592224633365094400?s=46&t=N0KodYTVMa9DWX4ViOFc8w)

We are Metis -- a decentralized autonomous company (a DAC) on a mission to build the infrastructure to power the Web3 economy. Thank you for having us today!

We will be answering your questions from 4 PM to 6 PM UTC. In addition to the AMA, we also bring $METIS airdrops for the participants and would like to share details on our bridge incentive program for Andromeda week!

**Airdrop:**

We are going to select 5 winners who asked the best questions and reward them with $METIS tokens.

**Bridge incentive program**:

We are presenting the bridging incentive program for new users to discover our ecosystem. During the Andromeda week you can bridge your assets to Andromeda mainnet for free on Metis official bridge.

* Dates: start on November 17th at 12 AM UTC (lasts 72 hours)
* Link to the bridge:[ https://bridge.metis.io/home](https://bridge.metis.io/home)
* Take full advantage of the DAPPS of our ecosystem, the list is here[ https://metis.io/ecosystem](https://metis.io/ecosystem)

Conditions for bridge incentive program:

* New wallets with no previous interaction with Metis token or Andromeda network;
* All the ones on the official bridge are eligible for the rebate (including USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, wBTC, Link, AAVE, BUSD, Sushi, except Metis Token);
* Min bridge amount of $100 inbound bridging into Andromeda Network;
* Max bridge fee rebate per wallet $100.

**Now, more info about Metis:**

Since mainnet launch a year ago we got:

* More than 4 million transactions;
* More than 95,000 active wallets;
* We reached $700+ millions in TVL;
* More than 50 DAPPS joined or launched in our ecosystem;
* 8 offline events organized worldwide, sponsored 14 and dozens attended!

The project was founded back in 2018, and the mainnet launched on the 19th of November 2021.

Today, our organization consists of 3 main departments (econodes):

1. **Smart L2** — a Layer 2 scaling solution on the Ethereum network, which is solving the persistent blockchain trilemma for Ethereum and increasing both transaction speed (faster finality) and throughput (more transactions per second), while keeping the lowest transaction fees in the industry;
2. **Matrix** — a solution we designed to unlock the potential of personal data ownership, reputation building, and universal decentralization by assimilating all digital identities in a single account, without sacrificing privacy or integrity. We allow you to augment and authenticate your digital reputation power, blending your crypto and DeFi accounts, NFT collections, credentials and achievements, and more, through a single metric;
3. **DAC Portal** — As the web3 industry matures, new models are shifting how decentralized companies operate and manage, such as the shift to the Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC). By evolving the shortcomings of a DAO, the DAC is creating a more useful infrastructure for businesses and companies, which we consider the shift to a company model. The DAC is for current DAOs, web3 businesses, and internet native companies (web2 alike) who are interested in optimizing the benefits of decentralized growth and on-chain operations.

The DAC project is relatively in stealth but we’re very excited to share more about what we are building during this AMA!

ytk4qn,metis,"FTX was audited by a ""metaverse firm"" called Praga Metis that also hosts a nightclub in Decentraland. You can't make this sh*t up.",CryptoCurrency,partymsl,2022-11-12 22:20:35,339,"A lot talk going around that every exchange should do proof of reserves to be fine, but a that's not nearly enough as even that could be very easily manipulated by some certain auditor. In the case of FTX there also was an auditor, a metaverse company that also operated in Decentraland (MANA if you still know it) where it had the ""Decentraland Babydolls"" Club.

I know that all may sound like parods but that's literally true. In 2021 that company confirmed $1b in revenue for FTX and has since then been very proud of having a relationship with FTX.

Now obviously they are not so proud. As the crypto newsletter CoinDesk approached them, their ""chief metaverse officer"" (a real role nowadays) said he does not not know anything about FTX and even said: ""I'm retired"".

That's all literally jokes but further highlights how important it is to not just get an audit done or a proof of reserve but it's also highly important by whom it is done. We all should be careful about that as a lot of exchanges will do unreliable audits the coming days just to try to gain our trust.

10qrxl2,metis,Moving to Japan with a METI internship,movingtojapan,AvailableSolution143,2023-02-01 11:42:09,2,"So I've been selected for the METI internship program, the internship lasts anywhere between 1 - 6 months. I'm planning to move around late May or early June. 

1. I want to know if there is anyone who has/had moved there for the same internship. If yes, can you give me some insight on what it's like? I'm going to be an embedded s.w engineering intern.
2. I'm planning to settle there once I complete my internship, the company said that they will consider making me a permanent employee if I perform well enough. Is settling there a good idea? (I'm from Sri Lanka and I see no future in my country, the economy is collapsing and we're all broke af)
3. I am yet to complete my (s.w engineering) degree and I'm planning to study online while in Japan, will it be too stressful with my work? Or should I save up and consider resuming after I'm made permanent?
4. What are the first things I should spend on when I move? What should I carry there with me?
5. I'm aware that there are a lot of rules and I can easily offend people if I don't use the right honorifics.. I shy away from speaking Japanese because of this reason, I haven't done JLPTs or anything, I learnt all my Japanese from 15 years of anime and manga. I am quite fluent, but I'm always anxious that I might offend someone by talking too casually. Are Japanese offended easily, and how do I work on this? 

My future (Japanese and foreign) coworkers have already contacted me, they're very friendly and told me that I will get used to the language within a month or so, and that my Japanese will improve with time, but I'm still extremely scared.

That's all I wanted to ask for now, please help me out, I'm still in college, I'm broke and I have no idea what to do :') . Thank you!!"

In December, Metis Andromeda surpassed all prior expectations: Layer Zero was integrated, Onto Wallet was integrated, Aave’s Temp. Check Vote was passed, the proposal for a Stargate deployment passed, and we’ve got multiple fascinating projects going through CEG. Nevertheless, January had just as big of plans for Andromeda.

Transaction Volume in Metis Andromeda grew by 1000% since January 1st.

Es importante que intentes sacar el hielo de inmediato si no puedes hacerlo. Si el hielo se ha adherido a la piel o se ha congelado en el ano, puede causar daños graves. Puedes intentar calentar la zona con compresas tibias o bañándote con agua tibia para intentar despegar el hielo. Si no puedes sacar el hielo por tu cuenta o si sientes dolor intenso, es importante buscar atención médica de inmediato. No es seguro dejar el hielo en el ano y puede ser necesario tratamiento médico para solucionar el problema."

So I found a greater interest in the story of metis children. One of them is Athena if I'm not confusing things, and the other is the unborn son, that is destined to overpower his father( right?).  However, id love to read up on some details about the story, do you know anywhere I can read more about it?

  
I'd love to hear any suggestions! Where do you usually look myths like that up? What do you think of the story at all?

Balenciaga Recyle T Shirt Size XS fits Baggy M - This is from LY. Fits oversized like retail and has correct color/blank quality. Overall an amazing rep. Sold to u/kingplutohendrix

Louis Vuitton Monogram T shirt from Reon - Cream Size S fits M. This was used by the previous owner from my understanding. It fits nicely and it feels like good material, but it was too bright for anything I owned. Neck tag is included, but unsewn. $45 Shipped or best offer.

Louis Vuitton Virgil Abloh Cuban Link Bracelet - This is a good rep of this bracelet in my opinion. The material itself is pretty weighted which is a plus in my eyes. This has been used and has some slight blemishes. Skin won’t turn green. Comes with all it’s original contents. SOLD

Deeds Number (N)ine Bondage Denim - All Black Size 1. I would say this would fit a 30 waist best. Very high quality denim and hardware. SOLD


Louis Vuitton Pochette Metis -  The bag was from TS Kelly if I’m not mistaken and sold for a little over $300 before shipping costs. The bag itself is lightly used but still in amazing condition. There is no flaws on this bag. It is extremely retail accurate and has correct heatstamp as well. I am also a vouched seller as well! I’m asking $190 or best offer.

Trabalho há anos com atendimento no ramo farmacêutico. Recentemente troquei de estado em questão de meu casamento. Sai de uma rede grande de farmácias pois fizeram uma filhadaputagem comigo .Alguém simplesmente arrombou o caixa registrador e tiraram uma quantia do meu caixa.

Depois de cerca de 4 meses após me mudar , acabei reingressando no ramo que atuei. Atendimento em farmácia.

Estava tudo tranquilo, fiz algumas filiais , como atendente , tirava um ticket médio bom, e no final do mês compensava a comissão. Uma nova gerente entrou , e a vagabunda já chegou **cortando minha função, minha comissão,** e tomei advertência por estar ""furando a fila dos atendentes"".

Jogaram meus 4 anos de experiência no lixo, me ligam fora do horário de serviço, e ainda me enchem o saco por não star disponível no turno inverso por causa da faculdade.

Estou comendo na mão dessa vagabunda pois minha esposa está gravida, to tentando manter a calma e só me resta rezar e passar no concurso que estou estudando"

Como bom trabalhador explorado q eu fui, passei um tempo na empresa juntando provas de vários abusos que passei na antiga empresa que trabalhei.

Desde o fato do meu ex patrão não ter assinado meu contrato até algumas ligações que ele fazia de madrugada para mim e eu gravei.

Com uma quantidade considerável de material e várias testemunhas o advogado me disse que conseguiríamos comprovar vínculo empregatício (trabalhava como PJ).

A ação foi montada e ele foi notificado ontem à tarde.

Por volta das 22h escuto palmas no portão e pra minha surpresa era o dito cujo querendo saber da carta q recebeu.

Ignorei e voltei pra minha jogatina noturna.

Eu não quero falar com ele, não quero ver ele, só quero ficar longe daquele explorador de mão de obra.

Agora ele está me mandando msg no WhatsApp e n duvido nada q daqui a pouco começa a me ligar tbm.

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/cerusnodes](https://twitter.com/cerusnodes)

Whitepaper: [https://whitepaper.cerusnodes.io/executive-summary/vision](https://whitepaper.cerusnodes.io/executive-summary/vision)

**TLDR:**

Cerus uses NFTs to allow users to buy a fraction (1% per NFT) of a Metis validator without requiring the full 200 $Metis for collateral.

NFT can be traded on the open market like any other asset.

Helps significantly decentralize Metis validator node program.

Metis validator rewards currently extremely high due to Metis distributing part of the rest of the supply for this and other programs to incentivize the ecosystem (120% APY).

Protocol also has token, $CERUS, which compounds rewards from the NFT.

Seems pretty novel to me, although someone briefly mentioned that a bunch of other protocols had something like this?

Anyway have at it."
