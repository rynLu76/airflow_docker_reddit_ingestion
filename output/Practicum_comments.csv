Plus I genuinely believe if you are decent enough you probably don't need a bootcamp to land you a job."
108zqmx,j3vmcut,yellowmamba_97,2023-01-11 11:03:43,9,"Damn, these tuition fees are almost equivalent to the MSc computer science degrees of UT Austin and Georgia Tech. Bootcamps are in my opinion not worth it if you pay such a heavy amount. You could basically replicate their curriculum with free or courses with a lower fee of the applicable vendors, such as Google or Amazon."
108zqmx,j3w0frz,j__neo,2023-01-11 13:28:18,6,"Hello there, I'd suggest checking out [Data Engineer Camp](https://dataengineercamp.com/) if you haven't already. Our next cohort is kicking off July/August 2023. Student testimonial [here](https://app.vouchfor.com/116QBDHIvO)."
108zqmx,j3xxnwy,chrisgarzon19,2023-01-11 20:49:59,2,"My problem with bootcamps is that’s not actually focused on getting you a job. I mean, 800 hours in 20 weeks?

You have 40 hours a week available?

That’s the difference between bootcamps and mentors btw 

A bootcamp focuses on teaching every nuance possible that you may never use again (like school)

Vs. a mentor who’s job is to accelerate your path


P.S I’m a proponent for free over bootcamps like these that are TOO structured"
108zqmx,j3x1h9b,tentative_guy22,2023-01-11 17:33:55,2,OP i hope you don’t feel discouraged by the feedback. They mean well. Thanks for sharing your effort.
108zqmx,j3ygpcg,None,2023-01-11 22:47:51,1,"if a bootcamp isnt free, its a scam. tech is unbelievably toxic with this crap."
108zqmx,j3z5ss5,Altruistic-Choice-37,2023-01-12 01:38:06,1,it's overpriced
108zqmx,j3vx7o4,jppbkm,2023-01-11 13:00:21,0,These both look like much worse content (and value) than what's available for free or cheap online.
108zqmx,j3vcgsm,_whitezetsu,2023-01-11 08:45:24,16,Apologies if this sounds rude but this is a ridiculous amount to pay for something you can learn for absolutely free.
108zqmx,j3vshvp,ThisMud5529,2023-01-11 12:15:04,4,"Yeah I totally agree. There loads of free materials and resources online. You might only need to spend some on cloud deployments if you've never used their free trials. 

I know some people prefer to go to these kind of bootcamps to have a structured and curated learning experience. Personally, for that price why not wait a month and try out courses on other platforms (ie. udemy/codecademy/coursera etc) Some even offer 30-day money back guarantee. And surely give DataTalks a try. It's free and starting on Jan 16 I think."
108zqmx,j3wcdqv,Proof_Elk_2281,2023-01-11 14:56:44,4,"I will second this and say you should do the DE zoomcamp. I did it with just basic coding experience (mostly R for some stats related to grad research) and had lots of interest in my resume when I was a fresh grad.

The best part is that you can focus on the parts that interest you the most. If you're really interested in analytics engineering you can go deep into a project with an ELT stack, if you want to focus on big data ETL you can do something with Spark, etc.. I did dbt and Airflow because I just picked something I time for while also finishing my degree. This time around I'm following along again and am going to do something with Kafka, just to learn the tech because I think it's interesting.

The only thing Alexey doesn't really cover that I think a paid bootcamp would is interview prep including DSA. But resources like neetcode have made things like DSA a lot more accessible to learn for free imo."
108zqmx,j3wbc8j,raz_the_kid0901,2023-01-11 14:49:42,1,I am going to give that datatalks a try. I need structure in my life.
108zqmx,j3yyc56,jun_dagster,2023-01-12 00:45:59,1,Appreciate letting me know about the Zoom camp!
108zqmx,j3wwdgw,mrchowmein,2023-01-11 17:03:27,2,"Yep, if one wants to pay university rates, might as well get that cs degree as that will go further than any BootCamp."
108zqmx,j6hc7e2,BrackishClarity,2023-01-30 09:20:57,2,Are there any mentorship type programs out there?
108zqmx,j3whkao,tigerkingsam,2023-01-11 15:30:58,6,What you’re saying is true but some people can’t self study and need some structure in place for them to focus like college. But yeah Datatalks club makes a lot of sense
108zqmx,j497pfp,None,2023-01-14 01:10:16,1,I actually want to eventually go for masters. But I need my professional to be strong enough to be able to get into a decent programme. The UT Austin programme looks to be decent and it's affordable. I just need to strengthen my profile
108zqmx,j6hmrcd,chrisgarzon19,2023-01-30 11:46:17,1,"[I have my own, so I’m biased!](https://dataengineerinterview.com/products/)"
108zqmx,j4978ly,None,2023-01-14 01:06:42,1,"Yeah that's where I am as well. Additionally, the camp I'm looking at will help give me a solid python base which I think I lack. After I'm done I'm going to go through the DTC stuff. DE, MLE, and MLOps. The way it was set up looks good. I just don't think I have the base to get what I need from it. It's a much more difficult ramp up without the background and one can get lost. The structure helps one realise it's just part of the journey"

10v7ult,j7fzfl4,St_Melangell,2023-02-06 15:04:41,2,"It has its good points but in my opinion, it’s far too wordy. Distil each job down to 4-5 of your top achievements, backing them up with numbers & data if applicable (such as simplifying a process, saving 80% of admin time). Also for the two studentships, I’d put them in a separate section, maybe Internships or similar."
10v7ult,j7g5gpp,gthirteen_13,2023-02-06 15:46:52,2,"First of all 2 pages? No way sir.

Why the graphic? Why isn't your name centered?  Why are the headers centered?  Why are there colors?  Shadows over the headers? you might think this looks fancy but it really just looks like it's formatted incorrectly.

get rid of ""data engineer"", the objective statement, and signature competencies.  Then take your education & affiliations/technical proficiencies combine them and call it skills and put that first thing after your name/info/etc...

Then you need to concentrate on shortening all the work experience down to the most important things, and be precise and use data.  Possibly changing the format to summarizing the exp (instead of bullets) and then bullet listing 3 accomplishments per job would be the way.  You might also think to omit the aws cloud admin, and ""student"" exp, and add an education section.

You have a lot of work to do before this is presentable to anyone that reads resumes.  I tossed it right away because it overwhelmed me with length PLUS it had an objective summary.  

You have a lot of great things but we don't need to know every single task you did, summarize.

Any tips on how I can ""datafy"" my accomplishments? i.e., ""My automation of widget production saved 98% of operational budget etc etc"".

""Addressed the lack of automation in data vetting process by creating python scripts that check the data and create reports based on existing criteria"", something like that."

That being said, the way to get better at ANYTHING related to coding is by practicing.  Pick a project that you care about, or start doing the data pipelines yourself at your job instead of handing them to DE’s. And that’s how you will get better at Data Engineering.

I attended one of these bootcamp and can provide you more info if you DM me.

Long story short, it is not necessary if you have the drive and a clear goal. I truly believe you can learn everything online if you want.

However if you are like me and needs that extra push and more hand holding, bootcamp can help to some degree. In the end it is up to you to make it in this field. Don't expect to come out with a job if you are not putting in the work.

In my case, it was not a bad idea, I have some SQL and ETL experience before and want to make it to the next level. Also money was not that much of an issue to me since I also did some time in the OG sector.

I just needed the structured and guided learning towards DE."

You want hands on experience.  Instead of $5-15K, spend $1000 on testing out the cloud for yourself.  

I was looking at a $4K Microsoft BI program a few years back.  It was going to take 9 months to complete.  Made a deal with myself that I could complete Microsoft Certs on my own, for less, in a shorter amount of time.  Posted those on LinkedIn and the recruiters found me.  Did the same with Azure and AWS.  

These certs usually cost $100, exam prep is about $150, plus a bunch of youtube and Udemy (about $15/course)."

I'm glad you took a different route while committing time to self development which led to you being noticed by the recruiters.

u76io5,i5cmu69,vasaforever,2022-04-19 15:01:40,2,"Some bootcamps can vary in quality so dig into their posted results and try to talk to other grads. If you can find a bootcamp from a public university like University of Michigan, MIT, Ohio State, that's a little better as you're getting the university's name and brand weight behind it, along with some access to teachers/teaching assistants that teach undergrad courses. 
You can also look at online industry job programs like Udacity, who have a pretty good Data program which also includes LinkedIn development, resume review, and job socials with top employers in your area or online depending on how the program is done.

Alex explains the path relatively well and also mentions the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera: https://youtu.be/yDG5KiiOZcQ

Luke goes into the technical and programming approach to how to learn Data in 2022 which I think is very well organized. https://youtu.be/CC66RXeTn_4

Tina also has a great discussion on how to maximize your learning in this space: https://youtu.be/Axu4tJl8gbM

In general, the job postings you see call for SQL, Python/R, some sort of BI tool so PowerBI or Tableau, and you're seeing cloud more."
u76io5,i5cj58k,None,2022-04-19 14:37:34,1,I'd start by asking your employer if there are any help desk positions available within the company in your area. See if they will pay for industry standard certifications even if there aren't any entry level tech positions. The most common cert is A+ the rest are much more specialized.
u76io5,i5cpya4,zubzup,2022-04-19 15:21:50,1,"Thank you. Am I able to skip data analytics and dive straigjr into Data Engineering, DEVops or data science. Reason is data analytics is entry level and less paid."
u76io5,i5cpmrv,zubzup,2022-04-19 15:19:50,2,Thing is I am already at a pay level and have financial obligations. I am also 31. Cannot go to a help desk job at this point in life..
u76io5,i5cr31t,vasaforever,2022-04-19 15:28:50,2,"DevOps is a completely different skill set than Data Engineering and using a different skill set and knowledge base.

Yes you can start learning Data Engineering now as it'll cover most of the same stuff you'd learn as an analyst except the BI tools. You'll need to have a good understanding of data storage, databases, APIs etc, cloud, etc. It's a lot more involved due to the number of tools and language.

It's more of a question of if you're able to get a Data Engineering role off the street without previous tech experience. If you have a finance or math degree, or requisite certifications and solid portfolio it's possible. It may be worth looking in your company to see if there are internal roles to increase your chances as well."
u76io5,i5cqnve,CWykes,2022-04-19 15:26:06,3,"Even if you have certifications and boot camps completed I’m pretty sure you’ll need to start in a support role like help desk anyways. The only thing that would allow you to start above support, besides connections or luck, is related experience. It’s an unfortunate pay cut many people have to take to start a career in this field, but if you like IT then it’s worth it"
u76io5,i5cq59u,OrangeyougladIposted,2022-04-19 15:23:00,1,"Help desk is a loaded term.   Helpdesks can go all the way to 70k

&#x200B;

To give other advice,   Python is a decent starting point and diving into data reporting platforms like PowerBI, tableau or crystal reports is a good way to get a foot in the door"
u76io5,i5cqk9t,None,2022-04-19 15:25:30,1,Maybe stay at your job and even try going back to school. To safely make a lateral move across two different careers with no experience or technical training will be challenging but not impossible.

Dats Science

u76io5,i5dzie9,vasaforever,2022-04-19 20:06:06,2,"You're welcome.

Your question borders on being binary and can't be answered by anyone but you. It's about you, your current education, goals, timeline, and what aspects of IT or CS that you enjoy. Since you're switching careers there is a different decision tree and requirements that can influence your decision.

To pull a quote from Stanislaw Lem ""there are no answers, only choices."""

u76hcp,i5dxwsc,zubzup,2022-04-19 19:56:19,1,"I agree.  


I am considering weclouddata and light house labs. Both are bassed in Toronto but are pricey ($10k)  


I could also go for MIT Data science course which is cheaper but I feel it will be more corporate."
u76hcp,i5erknk,Deep-Temperature,2022-04-19 23:11:38,1,"Before going for pricey bootcamps, consider going for free online material. Data science sounds nice but in reality the work you will get at entry level will be an analyst and if you are lucky some data science. Please tread with caution. There are other technologies/ skillsets that are easier to get into and pay will be good. It's better to go for full stack developement, DevOps, RPA,AWS etc."

rm8uos,hpkw766,BoneThrone92,2021-12-22 17:38:33,15,I would heavily recommend against this. The best way to pivot to data engineering is to start hopping to more technical roles. Trying getting a job as a data analyst and start using python. After a few years you'll be ready to make the jump. Hiring managers will prefer a BI dev or data analyst with work experience over a bootcamp.
rm8uos,hplksq4,mrchowmein,2021-12-22 20:24:08,6,"If you're an analyst already, try to find a position such as data analyst that works closely with DE/DS teams so you can learn the technical side. The bootcamps are not that useful beyond just giving you some background info about DE. It's a good way to polish your skillset, but that's about it in my opinion. People here ask about bootcamps every once in awhile. Between my friends and I who are also DEs at multiple companies, no one is getting hired based on DE bootcamps.  You kinda need to fall under 3 categories: an advanced degree that is CS or data related (such as chemistry where you have to write programs to perform analysis on a cluster), seasoned software engineer, or a data analyst. There are not many jr positions available in general as the upskilling required is relatively high compared to other types of software engineering roles. So the route for the non-engineer who doesnt want to go back to school is usually the data analyst route."
rm8uos,hplgld2,nudgekennels,2021-12-22 19:55:40,2,"Thanks, that makes sense. A follow up question — so WeCloudData offers the students an opportunity to work on “real client project” that they take on from various companies. I think that if I tried to get a job, I would be working, as you said, as an analyst. A part of me thinks that it would be better to be able to put a line on my resume that’s actually data engineering work, even if it’s pro bono through a bootcamp. What do you think?"
rm8uos,hplmlaz,nudgekennels,2021-12-22 20:36:13,1,"Thanks, that makes sense. So I mentioned this in my reply to another post, but one of the bootcamps offers the students an opportunity to work on “real client project” that they take on from various companies. I think that would be actual data engineering work I can put on my resume, even if it was pro bono work. Do you think there’s value in that? Or do you think that being an analyst and working closely with DE/DS team is better?"
rm8uos,hpmekfg,pacific_plywood,2021-12-22 23:55:40,1,"If you are already doing programmatic work, then - given some self-studying on the side - you could just get these roles without paying for a bootcamp"
rm8uos,hpm20c1,mrchowmein,2021-12-22 22:22:06,2,"I dunno what real client project means. How long is the bootcamp. If you can see a sample client project and is complex enough maybe it’s worth it. If I was in your shoes, I would go the analyst route and do a course or bootcamp while you’re analyst on the side."
rm8uos,hpm3m0o,nudgekennels,2021-12-22 22:33:39,1,"It’s fairly long. 25 weeks. Lectures Wednesday nights and Saturday all day. We’re supposed to work on the client projects during the week starting about 4-7 weeks in. I’m not currently working as an analyst, I just have about 5 years experience from a while ago. So I could either be applying for analyst jobs and doing the bootcamp part-time (which doesn’t come with the client project), or I could just do the bootcamp fulltime (which comes with the client project). I’ve asked about sample client project, but they said that because it’s for an actual client they can’t share it with me. It’s done with the guidance of one of the instructors. I feel like I might as well do the full-time, since it might take a bit of time to find an analyst job anyway? I’m not sure. Really appreciate the input by the way."

Considering your background, it is definitely a good idea to add on to your existing skills. There are many introductory courses available for free on youtube if you wanna get a good introduction into the field of data engineering. But an instructor guided course is always better. I would advise taking the course beforehand is definitely a good idea rather than taking it while you work on the same stuff(Might be a little overwhelming to do work and learn if you have the option of doing it beforehand)"

qaw2to,hh5s1jk,larry_is_not_my_name,2021-10-18 21:55:00,1,"Try to find the most reputable bootcamp or course you can that's as close to what you're looking for as possible.  A lot of your learning will come post bootcamp, either through your own initiative or on the job.

A bootcamp grad myself from a few years back, mostly it was a great way to get introduced to others in code and build a network while learning a few things.  That is, while a lot of the learning was ok (some of it was good and some of it was not), the real benefit was being in that space mentally and meeting others who want to do the same thing.

Since graduating and through work, I've built a lot of other projects using different tech stacks.  This is where most of my actual learning has taken place.

TL;DR Think of a bootcamp as a great place to start your learning rather than as a place to master anything.  More importantly, most people find that the network they make at a bootcamp to be more valuable than the learning, so do what you can to make solid connections."

When it came out, it was the only DE training out there with a verified certificate and a list of small projects that can make it sound like you've touched on the main things you should know as a junior DE. Data Warehouse, Data Lake, Spark, Airflow. I took this DEND with colleagues at work, and it felt like we can talk data engineering with a common set of knowledge. The DEND wasn't about the tools though: them covering OLTP vs OLAP, star schema, etc was great - as many DEs that I came across so far didn't seem to know about them and I found it frustrating.

I should mention, DataCamp also has a Data Engineer track that is much cheaper and covers similar content, but does lack in ""project"" experience. Recommend this one too.

Microsoft and Google both have their cloud specific certification on Data Engineering (AWS one is called Data Analytics Specialty) - but I think these will be great with actual cloud data engineering experience."
